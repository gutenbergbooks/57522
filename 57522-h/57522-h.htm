<h2 id="BROTHER_RABBITS_CRADLE">BROTHER RABBIT’S CRADLE</h2>

<p class="author">By Joel Chandler Harris</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I wish you’d tell me what you tote a hankcher
fer,” remarked Uncle Remus, after he
had reflected over the matter a little while.</p>

<p>“Why, to keep my mouth clean,” answered the
little boy. Uncle Remus looked at the lad, and
shook his head doubtfully. “Uh-uh!” he exclaimed.
“You can’t fool folks when dey git ez ol’ ez what I
is. I been watchin’ you now mo’ days dan I kin
count, an’ I ain’t never see yo’ mouf dirty ’nuff
fer ter be wiped wid a hankcher. It’s allers clean—too
clean for ter suit me. Dar’s yo’ pa, now;
when he wuz a little chap like you, his mouf useter
git dirty in de mornin’ an’ stay dirty plum twel
night. Dey wa’n’t sca’cely a day dat he didn’t look
like he been playin’ wid de pigs in de stable lot.
Ef he yever is tote a hankcher, he ain’t never show
it ter me.”</p>

<p>“He carries one now,” remarked the little boy
with something like a triumphant look on his
face.</p>

<p>“Tooby sho’,” said Uncle Remus; “tooby sho’ he
do. He start ter totin’ one when he tuck an’ tuck a
notion fer ter go a-courtin’. It had his name in one
cornder, an’ he useter sprinkle it wid stuff out’n a
pepper-sauce bottle. It sho’ wuz rank, dat stuff
wuz; it smell so sweet it make you fergit whar you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
live at. I take notice dat you ain’t got none on
yone.”</p>

<p>“No; mother says that cologne or any kind
of perfumery on your handkerchief makes you
common.”</p>

<p>Uncle Remus leaned his head back, closed his
eyes, and permitted a heart-rending groan to issue
from his lips. The little boy showed enough anxiety
to ask him what the matter was. “Nothin’ much,
honey; I wuz des tryin’ fer ter count how many
diffunt kinder people dey is in dis big worl’, an’ ’fo’
I got mo’ dan half done wid my countin’, a pain
struck me in my mizry, an’ I had ter break off.”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” said the child. “You
think mother is queer; grandmother thinks so
too.”</p>

<p>“How come you to be so wise, honey?” Uncle
Remus inquired, opening his eyes wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I know by the way you talk, and by the way
grandmother looks sometimes,” answered the little
boy.</p>

<p>Uncle Remus said nothing for some time. When
he did speak, it was to lead the little boy to believe
that he had been all the time engaged in thinking
about something else. “Talkin’ er dirty folks,” he
said, “you oughter seed yo’ pa when he wuz a little
bit er chap. Dey wuz long days when you couldn’t
tell ef he wuz black er white, he wuz dat dirty.
He’d come out’n de big house in de mornin’ ez
clean ez a new pin, an’ ’fo’ ten er-clock you couldn’t
tell what kinder clof his cloze wuz made out’n.
Many’s de day when I’ve seed ol’ Miss—dat’s yo’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
great-gran’mammy—comb ’nuff trash out’n his
head fer ter fill a basket.”</p>

<p>The little boy laughed at the picture that Uncle
Remus drew of his father. “He’s very clean, now,”
said the lad loyally.</p>

<p>“Maybe he is an’ maybe he ain’t,” remarked
Uncle Remus, suggesting a doubt. “Dat’s needer
here ner dar. Is he any better off clean dan what
he wuz when you couldn’t put yo’ han’s on ’im widout
havin’ ter go an’ wash um? Yo’ gran’mammy
useter call ’im a pig, an’ clean ez he may be now, I
take notice dat he makes mo’ complaint er headache
an’ de heartburn dan what he done when he wuz
runnin’ roun’ here half-naked an’ full er mud. I
hear tell dat some nights he can’t git no sleep, but
when he wuz little like you—no, suh, I’ll not say
dat, bekaze he wuz bigger dan what you is fum de
time he kin toddle roun’ widout nobody he’pin’ him;
but when he wuz ol’ ez you an’ twice ez big, dey
ain’t narry night dat he can’t sleep—an’ not only
all night, but half de day ef dey’d ’a’ let ’im. Ef
dey’d let you run roun’ here like he done, an’ git
dirty, you’d git big an’ strong ’fo’ you know it.
Dey ain’t nothin’ mo’ wholesomer dan a peck er two
er clean dirt on a little chap like you.”</p>

<p>There is no telling what comment the child would
have made on this sincere tribute to clean dirt, for
his attention was suddenly attracted to something
that was gradually taking shape in the hands of
Uncle Remus. At first it seemed to be hardly worthy
of notice, for it had been only a thin piece of
board. But now the one piece had become four
pieces, two long and two short, and under the deft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
manipulations of Uncle Remus it soon assumed a
boxlike shape.</p>

<p>The old man had reached the point in his work
where silence was necessary to enable him to do it
full justice. As he fitted the thin boards together,
a whistling sound issued from his lips, as though
he were letting off steam; but the singular noise
was due to the fact that he was completely absorbed
in his work. He continued to fit and trim, and
trim and fit, until finally the little boy could no
longer restrain his curiosity. “Uncle Remus, what
are you making?” he asked plaintively.</p>

<p>“Larroes fer ter kech meddlers,” was the prompt
and blunt reply.</p>

<p>“Well, what are larroes to catch meddlers?” the
child insisted.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much an’ sump’n mo’. Dicky, Dicky,
killt a chicky, an’ fried it quicky, in de oven, like
a sloven. Den ter his daddy’s Sunday hat, he tuck
’n’ hitched de ol’ black cat. Now what you reckon
make him do dat? Ef you can’t tell me word fer
word an’ spellin’ fer spellin’ we’ll go out an’ come
in an’ take a walk.”</p>

<p>He rose, grunting as he did so, thus paying an
unintentional tribute to the efficacy of age as the
partner of rheumatic aches and stiff joints. “You
hear me gruntin’,” he remarked—“well, dat’s bekaze
I ain’t de chicky fried by Dicky, which he e’t
’nuff fer ter make ’im sicky.” As he went out the
child took his hand, and went trotting along by
his side, thus affording an interesting study for
those who concern themselves with the extremes of
life. Hand in hand the two went out into the fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and thence into the great woods, where Uncle Remus,
after searching about for some time, carefully
deposited his oblong box, remarking: “Ef I
don’t make no mistakes, dis ain’t so mighty fur fum
de place whar de creeturs has der playgroun’, an’
dey ain’t no tellin’ but what one un um’ll creep in
dar when deyer playin’ hidin’, an’ ef he do, he’ll sho
be our meat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a trap!” exclaimed the little boy, his
face lighting up with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“An’ dey wa’n’t nobody here fer ter tell you,”
Uncle Remus declared, astonishment in his tone.
“Well, ef dat don’t bang my time, I ain’t no free
nigger. Now, ef dat had ’a’ been yo’ pa at de same
age, I’d ’a’ had ter tell ’im forty-lev’m times, an’
den he wouldn’t ’a’ b’lieved me twel he see sump’n
in dar tryin’ fer ter git out. Den he’d say it wuz
a trap, but not befo’. I ain’t blamin’ ’im,” Uncle
Remus went on, “kaze ’tain’t eve’y chap dat kin tell
a trap time he see it, an’ mo’ dan dat, traps don’
allers sketch what dey er sot fer.”</p>

<p>He paused, looked all round, and up in the sky,
where fleecy clouds were floating lazily along, and
in the tops of the trees, where the foliage was swaying
gently in the breeze. Then he looked at the
little boy. “Ef I ain’t gone an’ got los’,” he said,
“we ain’t so mighty fur fum de place whar Mr.
Man, once ’pon a time—not yo’ time ner yit my
time, but some time—tuck’n’ sot a trap fer Brer
Rabbit. In dem days, dey hadn’t l’arnt how ter
be kyarpenters, an’ dish yer trap what I’m tellin’
you ’bout wuz a great contraption. Big ez Brer
Rabbit wuz, it wuz lots too big fer him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, whiles Mr. Man wuz fixin’ up dis trap,
Mr. Rabbit wa’n’t so mighty fur off. He hear de
saw—er-rash! er-rash!—an’ he hear de hammer—bang,
bang, bang!—an’ he ax hisse’f what all dis
racket wuz ’bout. He see Mr. Man come out’n
his yard totin’ sump’n, an’ he got furder off; he see
Mr. Man comin’ todes de bushes, an’ he tuck ter
de woods; he see ’im comin’ todes de woods, an’ he
tuck ter de bushes. Mr. Man tote de trap so fur an’
no furder. He put it down, he did, an’ Brer Rabbit
watch ’im; he put in de bait, an’ Brer Rabbit
watch ’im; he fix de trigger, an’ still Brer Rabbit
watch ’im. Mr. Man look at de trap an’ it
satchify him. He look at it an’ laugh, an’ when he
do dat Brer Rabbit wunk one eye, an’ wiggle his
mustache, an’ chaw his cud.</p>

<p>“An’ dat ain’t all he do, needer. He sot out in de
bushes, he did, an’ study how ter git some game in
de trap. He study so hard, an’ he got so errytated,
dat he thumped his behime foot on de groun’ twel
it soun’ like a cow dancin’ out dar in de bushes, but
’twan’t no cow, ner yit no calf—’twus des Brer
Rabbit studyin’. Atter so long a time, he put out
down de road todes dat part er de country whar
mos’ er de creeturs live at. Eve’y time he hear a
fuss, he’d dodge in de bushes, kaze he wanter see
who comin’. He keep on an’ he keep on, an’ bimeby
he hear ol’ Brer Wolf trottin’ down de road.</p>

<p>“It so happen dat Brer Wolf wuz de ve’y one
what Brer Rabbit wanter see. Dey wuz perlite ter
one an’er, but dey wan’t no frien’ly feelin’ ’twix
um. Well, here come ol’ Brer Wolf, hongrier dan
a chicken-hawk on a frosty mornin’, an’ ez he come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
up he see Brer Rabbit set by de side er de road
lookin’ like he done lose all his fambly an’ his
friends terboot.</p>

<p>“Dey pass de time er day, an’ den Brer Wolf
kinder grin an’ say, ‘Laws-a-massy, Brer Rabbit!
what ail you? You look like you done had a spell
er fever an’ ague; what de trouble?’ ‘Trouble,
Brer Wolf? You ain’t never see no trouble twel
you git whar I’m at. Maybe you wouldn’t min’ it
like I does, kaze I ain’t usen ter it. But I boun’
you done seed me light-minded fer de las’ time.
I’m done—I’m plum wo’ out,’ sez Brer Rabbit,
sezee. Dis make Brer Wolf open his eyes wide.
He say, ‘Dis de fus’ time I ever is hear you talk
dat-a-way, Brer Rabbit; take yo’ time an’ tell me
’bout it. I ain’t had my brekkus yit, but dat don’t
make no diffunce, long ez youer in trouble. I’ll
he’p you out ef I kin, an’ mo’ dan dat, I’ll put
some heart in de work.’ When he say dis, he grin
an’ show his tushes, an’ Brer Rabbit kinder edge
’way fum ’im. He say, ‘Tell me de trouble, Brer
Rabbit, an’ I’ll do my level bes’ fer ter he’p you
out.’</p>

<p>“Wid dat, Brer Rabbit ’low dat Mr. Man done
been had ’im hired fer ter take keer er his truck
patch, an’ keep out de minks, de mush-rats an’ de
weasels. He say dat he done so well settin’ up
night after night, when he des might ez well been
in bed, dat Mr. Man prommus ’im sump’n extry
’sides de mess er greens what he gun ’im eve’y day.
Atter so long a time, he say, Mr. Man ’low dat he
gwineter make ’im a present uv a cradle so he kin
rock de little Rabs ter sleep when dey cry. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
said, so done, he say. Mr. Man make de cradle an’
tell Brer Rabbit he kin take it home wid ’im.</p>

<p>“He start out wid it, he say, but it got so heavy
he hatter set it down in de woods, an’ dat’s de
reason why Brer Wolf seed ’im settin’ down by de
side er de road, lookin’ like he in deep trouble.
Brer Wolf sot down, he did, an’ study, an’ bimeby
he say he’d like mighty well fer ter have a cradle fer
his chillun, long ez cradles wuz de style. Brer Rabbit
say dey been de style fer de longest, an’ ez fer
Brer Wolf wantin’ one, he say he kin have de one
what Mr. Man make fer him, kaze it’s lots too big
fer his chillun. ‘You know how folks is,’ sez Brer
Rabbit, sezee. ‘Dey try ter do what dey dunner
how ter do, an’ dar’s der house bigger dan a barn,
an’ dar’s de fence wid mo’ holes in it dan what dey
is in a saine, an’ kaze dey have great big chillun dey
got de idee dat eve’y cradle what dey make mus’
fit der own chillun. An’ dat’s how come I can’t
tote de cradle what Mr. Man make fer me mo’ dan
ten steps at a time.’</p>

<p>“Brer Wolf ax Brer Rabbit what he gwineter
do fer a cradle, an’ Brer Rabbit ’low he kin manage
fer ter git ’long wid de ol’ one twel he kin
’suade Mr. Man ter make ’im en’er one, an’ he don’t
speck dat’ll be so mighty hard ter do. Brer Wolf
can’t he’p but b’lieve dey’s some trick in it, an’ he
say he ain’t see de ol’ cradle when las’ he wuz at
Brer Rabbit house. Wid dat, Brer Rabbit bust out
laughin’. He say, ‘Dat’s been so long back, Brer
Wolf, dat I done fergit all ’bout it; ’sides dat, ef
dey wuz a cradle dar, I boun’ you my ol’ ’oman
got better sense dan ter set de cradle in der parler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
whar comp’ny comes’; an’ he laugh so loud an’ long
dat he make Brer Wolf right shame er himse’f.</p>

<p>“He ’low, ol’ Brer Wolf did, ‘Come on, Brer
Rabbit, an’ show me whar de cradle is. Ef it’s too
big fer yo’ chillun, it’ll des ’bout fit mine.’ An’ so
off dey put ter whar Mr. Man done sot his trap.
’Twa’n’t so mighty long fo’ dey got whar dey wuz
gwine, an’ Brer Rabbit say, ‘Brer Wolf, dar yo’
cradle, an’ may it do you mo’ good dan it’s yever
done me!’ Brer Wolf walk all roun’ de trap an’
look at it like ’twas ’live. Brer Rabbit thump one er
his behime foots on de groun’ an’ Brer Wolf jump
like some un done shot a gun right at ’im. Dis
make Brer Rabbit laugh twel he can’t laugh no mo’.
Brer Wolf, he say he kinder nervous ’bout dat time
er de year, an’ de leas’ little bit er noise ’ll make ’im
jump. He ax how he gwineter git any purchis on
de cradle, an’ Brer Rabbit say he’ll hatter git inside
an’ walk wid it on his back, kaze dat de way he
done done.</p>

<p>“Brer Wolf ax what all dem contraptions on de
inside is, an’ Brer Rabbit ’spon’ dat dey er de
rockers, an’ dey ain’t no needs fer ter be skeer’d un
um, kaze dey ain’t nothin’ but plain wood. Brer
Wolf say he ain’t ’zactly skeer’d, but he done got
ter de p’int whar he know dat you better look ’fo’
you jump. Brer Rabbit ’low dat ef dey’s any
jumpin’ fer ter be done, he de one ter do it, an’
he talk like he done fergit what dey come fer. Brer
Wolf, he fool an’ fumble roun’, but bimeby he walk
in de cradle, sprung de trigger, an’ dar he wuz!
Brer Rabbit, he holler out, ‘Come on, Brer Wolf;
des hump yo’se’f, an’ I’ll be wid you.’ But try ez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he will an’ grunt ez he may, Brer Wolf can’t budge
dat trap. Bimeby Brer Rabbit git tired er waitin’,
an’ he say dat ef Brer Wolf ain’t gwineter come on
he’s gwine home. He ’low dat a frien’ what say
he gwineter he’p you, an’ den go in a cradle an’ drap
off ter sleep, dat’s all he wanter know ’bout um; an’
wid dat he made fer de bushes, an’ he wa’n’t a
minnit too soon, kaze here come Mr. Man fer ter see
ef his trap had been sprung. He look, he did, an’,
sho’ nuff, it ’uz sprung, an’ dey wuz sump’n in dar,
too, kaze he kin hear it rustlin’ roun’ an’ kickin’ fer
ter git out.</p>

<p>“Mr. Man look thoo de crack, an’ he see Brer
Wolf, which he wuz so skeer’d twel his eye look
right green. Mr. Man say, ‘Aha! I got you, is I?’
Brer Wolf say, ‘Who?’ Mr. Man laugh twel he
can’t sca’cely talk, an’ still Brer Wolf say, ‘Who?
Who you think you got?’ Mr. Man ’low, ‘I don’t
think, I knows. Youer ol’ Brer Rabbit, dat’s who
you is.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘Turn me outer here, an’
I’ll show you who I is.’ Mr. Man laugh fit ter kill.
He ’low, ‘You neenter change yo’ voice; I’d know
you ef I met you in de dark. Youer Brer Rabbit,
dat’s who you is.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘I ain’t not;
dat’s what I’m not!’</p>

<p>“Mr. Man look thoo de crack ag’in, an’ he see
de short years. He ’low, ‘You done cut off yo’ long
years, but still I knows you. Oh, yes! an’ you done
sharpen you mouf an’ put smut on it—but you
can’t fool me.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘Nobody ain’t tryin’
fer ter fool you. Look at my fine long bushy tail.’
Mr. Man ’low, ‘You done tied an’er tail on behime
you, but you can’t fool me. Oh, no, Brer Rabbit!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
You can’t fool me.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘Look at de
ha’r on my back; do dat look like Brer Rabbit?
Mr. Man ’low, ‘You done wallered in de red san’,
but you can’t fool me.’</p>

<p>“Brer Wolf say, ‘Look at my long black legs; do
dey look like Brer Rabbit?’ Mr. Man ’low, ‘You
kin put an’er j’int in yo’ legs, an’ you kin smut um,
but you can’t fool me.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘Look at
my tushes; does dey look like Brer Rabbit?’ Mr.
Man ’low, ‘You done got new toofies, but you can’t
fool me.’ Brer Wolf say, ‘Look at my little eyes;
does dey look like Brer Rabbit?’ Mr. Man ’low,
‘You kin squinch yo’ eye-balls, but you can’t fool
me, Brer Rabbit.’ Brer Wolf squall out, ‘I ain’t
not Brer Rabbit, an’ yo’ better turn me out er dis
place so I kin take hide an’ ha’r off’n Brer Rabbit.’
Mr. Man say, ‘Ef bofe hide an’ ha’r wuz off, I’d
know you, kaze ’tain’t in you fer ter fool me.’ An’
it hurt Brer Wolf feelin’s so bad fer Mr. Man ter
sput his word, dat he bust out inter a big boo-boo,
an’ dat’s ’bout all I know.”</p>

<p>“Did the man really and truly think that Brother
Wolf was Brother Rabbit?” asked the little boy.</p>

<p>“When you pin me down dat-a-way,” responded
Uncle Remus, “I’m bleeze ter tell you dat I ain’t
too certain an’ sho’ ’bout dat. De tale come down
fum my great gran’daddy’s great gran’daddy; it
come on down ter my daddy, an’ des ez he gun it
ter me, des dat-a-way I done gun it ter you.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Paul Baxter was too small to be head of
the family. He was only seven, while his
sister was five, and Paul thought she had a great
deal to learn. Mrs. Baxter was the rest of the
family, for the father had sailed away with the fishing
fleet one foggy morning, and the fleet came
back without one boat, and that boat was John
Baxter’s. They all thought he was drowned, but
they were wrong, as you will see. Meanwhile you
must pretend you don’t know he is alive, or else you
can’t understand what an unhappy time Mrs. Baxter
was living through, and how much rested on
Paul’s little shoulders while he considered himself
the head of the family.</p>

<p>The worst time had not come yet, for the father
had saved some money, and he had not been missing
more than about two weeks. Mrs. Baxter knew
that the money would soon be gone, so she was saving
every cent she could.</p>

<p>On the day before Thanksgiving, she told Paul
and his sister Kate that “until their father came
home again” (for she would not speak as if he were
lost), they must be very careful, and so their
Thanksgiving dinner would have to be a very plain
one.</p>

<p>“No turkey?” Kate asked.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” said their mother, “unless you and
Paul can catch one somewhere in the street.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>They knew this was a joke, for they lived in
South Street, New York City, where trucks
rumbled about all day.</p>

<p>Paul felt he must get a turkey for a reason Mrs.
Baxter didn’t know. As John Baxter was bidding
Paul good-bye the night before he sailed, Paul
had asked whether he would be back for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“I think so, my boy, but one can’t be sure. If I
shouldn’t, you must see to the Thanksgiving dinner,
and carve the turkey. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Paul, very proud, and now how could
he, if there was none to carve? Paul made up his
mind that it was his business to see that the family
had a turkey. Paul had some money in his own
small cast-iron bank. And he knew it was right for
him to do what he liked with his savings. He had
already offered them to his mother, and she had told
him they were of no use to her. Kate, too, had some
money in her bank; it was just like Paul’s except
that there was a “K” on the door, made with a red
pencil.</p>

<p>While their mother was clearing away the breakfast,
Paul beckoned to Kate and proposed that they
should put their money together and surprise
mother with the biggest, fattest, finest bird in the
market.</p>

<p>Kate feared the bird would cost too much.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, child,” said Paul, grandly; “why, I
have more than seventy-five cents. How much
have you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight, I think,” said Kate.</p>

<p>“Well, then!” Paul answered; “that’s more’n a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dollar. You can buy ’most anything for a dollar,
child.”</p>

<p>They opened the banks, and counted the money
three times, to make sure. It came out different
every time, but they had about one dollar and fifteen
or eighteen cents. It was all in small pieces
and looked enough to buy an elephant. Paul tied
it all up carefully in the corner of his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then, after they had helped their mother to tidy
the rooms, they got permission to go to market for
her. She told them what to buy, and Paul was
glad when his mother told them to get some cranberries
for sauce, and a plum-pudding that came in
a tin can. With their turkey, what a feast these
would make!</p>

<p>The market was not far away, but it was so
crowded that Paul and Kate had to hold hands
tight. For a long time they could get no attention,
but at last, by pulling one of the marketmen’s
aprons, Paul made him listen. Paul bought all the
things on their list, and then said, proudly:</p>

<p>“Please show me some of the biggest turkeys.”</p>

<p>The marketman, pointing to a long row, remarked:</p>

<p>“There they are—all weighed and marked. Pick
out the one you want.”</p>

<p>Paul examined the tickets stuck on the turkeys—$2.20,
$3.50, $2.40, $4.00 (he was a perfect giant
of a gobbler!) and so on. Paul felt a lump in his
throat, he was so disappointed! Then little Kate
made it worse by pointing to the very biggest and
saying, “Oh, Paul, buy that!—it’s the best of all!”</p>

<p>Paul whispered to her, “It costs four dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Isn’t that <em>awful</em>? The cheapest one is two dollars!
What can we do?”</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. Then she had a bright
idea.</p>

<p>“I know!” she said. “If we can’t have the biggest,
let’s get the very littlest that ever was! It will
be cunning, and that will make mamma laugh.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see any very little ones,” Paul replied.</p>

<p>“Ask the man,” Kate urged.</p>

<p>It was some time before Paul could get the man’s
attention, and then the question was put.</p>

<p>“The littlest turkey?” repeated the marketman,
with a grin. “That’s a queer order, now. Why do
you want the littlest one, my boy?”</p>

<p>“’Cause we’re buying it for mamma,” said Kate
eagerly. “She can’t get one at all, because papa’s
gone away, and he <em>may</em> not come back, and we got
the money out of our banks, and we’ve only one
dollar and fifteen cents, and we can’t have the biggest,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the marketman, “here’s a talker
for a little one! Haven’t I seen you before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Kate answered. “I’m Katie Baxter,
and I used to come with papa.”</p>

<p>“You Jack Baxter’s girl?” asked the marketman,
stooping down and picking the child up.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Kate, “but please put me down.”
But instead the man called to a marketman in the
next stall,</p>

<p>“See here O’Neil, this is the Baxter girl. She’s
come with another little kid to buy the littlest turkey
for her mother. They’ve got the money out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of their banks, and it’s a dollar fifteen. Can’t we
fill the order?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we <em>can</em>,” said the other marketman
heartily. “We’ll send them a bird—with the
stuffing, too!”</p>

<p>“It’ll be all right,” said the first marketman,
putting little Kate on her feet again. “Give
me the number, and we’ll send the bird around
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Paul gave the number, untied the money from
his handkerchief, and away they went through the
noisy street home.</p>

<p>Paul and Kate had hard work to keep the secret
of their marketing, but they did, all that day, and
the next.</p>

<p>About four o’clock there was a knock at the
door, and when the door was opened, there was
nobody there. But there was something. A big,
big market-basket, and in it was the giant turkey,
and on the turkey’s breast a piece of paper, saying:</p>

<p>“From the friends of John Baxter to Mrs. Baxter
and the little Baxters, hoping they’ll enjoy their
Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>And that wasn’t all, for the turkey, when Mrs.
Baxter came to prepare it, was stuffed with silver
dollars.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Baxter cried; and Paul and Kate
were puzzled by that. But she was thankful, for
she told them so.</p>

<p>When the great bird was properly browned and
smoking, Paul took his place ready to carve. He
had just raised the knife and fork when the door
opened and a big, hearty sailor came in, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, here, young man, this won’t do! That is
<em>my</em> place!”</p>

<p>And, of course, it was John Baxter; and the turkey
was not nearly so hot by the time he had been
hugged and kissed (meaning John Baxter, of
course), and had told how his boat had been sunk,
but he and his mates picked up by a steamer.</p>

<p>That <em>was</em> a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>Next day John Baxter took his boy and girl
down to the market, and they made another giving
of thanks to the marketmen, and that is a good
ending to the story, isn’t it?</p>

<p>There is one more thing. The marketmen would
not take back their silver, and so it went into the
bank—a real bank this time—for Paul and Kate.</p>

<h2 id="A_STORY_OF_DECORATION_DAY_FOR_THE_LITTLE_CHILDREN_OF_TO-DAY">A STORY OF DECORATION DAY FOR THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF TO-DAY</h2>

<p class="author">By Elisabeth Harrison</p>

<p class="dropcap">I want you to listen to a sad, sweet story to-day,
and yet one that ought to make you glad—glad
that such men have lived as those of whom I
am going to tell you. It all happened a good
many years ago, in fact so long ago that your fathers
and mothers were little boys and girls in kilts
and pinafores, some of them mere babies in long
clothes.</p>

<p>One bright Sunday morning in April the telegraph
wires could be heard repeating the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
things all over the land, “Tic, tic; tictic; t-i-c; tic,
tictic;—tic, t-i-c, tic; t-i-c; tic, t-i-c; t-i-c, t-i-c, tic,”
they called out, and the drowsy telegraph operators
sat up in their chairs as if startled by the words
the wires were saying.</p>

<p>“Tic, t-i-c, tic; tictic; tic, tictic; tic; t-i-c, tictic;—tic,
tic; t-i-c, tic,” continued the wires, and the faces
of the telegraph operators grew pale. Any looker-on
could have seen that something dreadful was
being told by the wires.</p>

<p>“Tic, t-i-c, tic; tictic; tic, tictic; tic; t-i-c, tictic;—tic,
tic; t-i-c, tic,” again repeated the wires. There
was no mistaking the message this time. Alas, alas,
it was true! The terrible news was true! Even
the bravest among the operators trembled.</p>

<p>Then came the rapid writing out of the fearful
words that the slender wires had uttered, the hurrying
to and fro; and messenger boys were seen flying
to the great newspaper offices, and the homes
of the mayors of the cities, and to the churches
where already the people were beginning to assemble.
For the deep-toned Sabbath church bells high
up in the steeples had been ringing out their welcome
to all, even the strangers in their midst—“Bim!
Baum! Bim!” they sang, which everybody
knew meant, “Come to church, dear people! Come!
Come! Come!” And the people strolled leisurely
along toward the churches—fathers and mothers
and little ones, and even grandfathers and grandmothers.
It was such a bright, pleasant day that
it seemed a joy to go to the house of God and
thank Him for all His love and care. So one
family after another filed into their pews while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
organist played such soft, sweet music that everybody
felt soothed and quieted by it.</p>

<p>Little did they dream of the awful words which
the telegraph wires were at that very moment calling
out with their “Tic, t-i-c, tic; t-i-c; tic, t-i-c;
t-i-c, t-i-c, tic;—Tic, t-i-c, tic, tictic, tic, tictic; tic;
t-i-c; tictic.”</p>

<p>The clergymen came in and took their places in
the pulpits. In each church the organ ceased its
wordless song of praise. The congregation bowed
and silently joined with all their hearts in the
petitions which the clergyman was offering to the
dear Lord, Father of all mankind, Ruler of heaven
and earth. Some of them softly whispered “Amen”
as he asked protection for their homes and their
beloved country. Did they know anything about
the danger which even then hung over them? Perhaps
they did.</p>

<p>In many of the churches the prayer was over,
the morning hymn had been sung, when a stir and
bustle at the door might have been noticed, as the
messenger boys, excited and out of breath, handed
their yellow envelopes to the ushers who stood near
the door ready to show the late comers to unoccupied
seats. First one and then the other ushers
read the message, and from some one of them escaped,
in a hushed whisper, the words, “Oh, God!
Has it come to this!”</p>

<p>And all looked white and awe-struck. The head
usher hurried tremblingly down the aisle, and without
waiting for the clergyman to finish reading the
announcements of the week, laid the telegram upon
the pulpit desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The clergyman, somewhat surprised at such an
interruption, glanced at the paper, stopped,
gasped, picked it up, and re-read the words written
upon it, as though he could not believe his own
eyes. Then he advanced a step forward, holding
on to the desk, as if he had been struck a blow by
some unseen hand. The congregation knew that
something terrible had happened, and their hearts
seemed to stop beating as they leaned forward to
catch his words.</p>

<p>“My people,” said he in a slow, deliberate tone,
as if it were an effort to steady his voice, “I hold
in my hand a message from the President of the
United States.” Then his eyes dropped to the
paper which he still held, and now his voice rang
out clear and loud as he read, “<em>Our Flag has been
fired upon! Seventy-five thousand troops wanted
at once.</em> Abraham Lincoln.”</p>

<p class="tb">I could not make you understand all that took
place the next week or two any more than the little
children who heard what the telegram said, understood
it. Men came home, hurried and excited, to
hunt up law papers, or to straighten out deeds,
saying in constrained tones to the pale-faced
women, “I will try to leave all business matters
straight before I go.” There was solemn consultations
between husbands and wives, which usually
ended in the father’s going out, stern-faced and
silent, and the mother, dry-eyed but with quivering
lips, seeking her own room, locking herself in for
an hour, then coming out to the wondering children
with a quiet face, but with eyes that showed she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had been weeping. There were gatherings in the
town halls and in the churches and school houses
all over the land. The newspapers were read hurriedly
and anxiously.</p>

<p>And when little Robert looked up earnestly into
his grandmamma’s face and asked, “Why does
mamma not eat her breakfast?” grandmamma replied,
“Your papa is going away, my dear.” And
when little Robert persisted, by saying, “But papa
goes to New York every year, and mamma does
not sit and stare out of the window, and forget
to eat her breakfast,” then mamma would turn
solemnly around and say, “Robert, my boy, papa
is going to the war, and may never come back to
us. But you and I must be brave about it, and
help him get ready.” And if Robert answered,
“Why is he going to the war? Why does he not
stay at home with us? Doesn’t he love us any
more?” then mamma would draw her boy to
her and putting her arms around him, and looking
into his eyes, she would say, “Yes, my darling, he
loves us, but he <em>must</em> go. Our country needs him,
and you and I must be proud that he is ready to do
his duty.”</p>

<p>Then Robert would go away to his play, wondering
what it all meant, just as you would have
wondered if you had been there.</p>

<p>Soon the papas and uncles, and even some of the
grandfathers, put on soldiers’ uniforms, and drilled
in the streets with guns over their shoulders, and
bands of music played military music, and the
drums beat, and crowds of people collected on the
street corners, and there were more speeches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
more flags, and banners, and stir, and excitement.
And nothing else was talked of but the war, the
war, the terrible war.</p>

<p>Then came the marching away of the soldiers
to the railway stations, and then the farewells and
cheers and waving of handkerchiefs and the playing
of patriotic airs by the bands of music, and
much more confusion and excitement and good-bye
kisses and tears than I could tell you of.</p>

<p class="tb">Then came the long, long days of waiting and
praying in the homes to which fathers and brothers
no longer came, and silent watching for letters, and
anxious opening of the newspapers, and oftentimes
the little children felt their mamma’s tears drop on
their faces as she kissed them good-night—their
dear mamma who so often had sung them to sleep
with her gay, happy songs—what did it all mean?
They could not tell.</p>

<p>And all this time the fathers, brave men as they
were, had been marching down to the war. Oftentimes
they slept on the hard ground with only their
army blankets wrapped around them, and the stars
to keep watch over them, and many a day they had
nothing to eat but dry bread and black coffee, because
they had not time to cook more, and sometimes
they had no breakfast at all because they
must be up by daybreak and march on, even if the
rain poured down, as it sometimes did, wetting them
through and through.</p>

<p>What were such hardships when <em>their country
was in danger</em>?</p>

<p>Then came the terrible, terrible battles, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
awful than anything you ever dreamed of. Men
were shot down by the thousands, and many who
did not lose their lives had a leg shot off, or an arm
so crushed that it had to be cut off. Still they
bravely struggled on. It was for their beloved
country they were fighting, and for it they must
be willing to suffer, or to die.</p>

<p>Then a hundred thousand more soldiers were
called for, and then another hundred thousand, and
still the bloody war continued. For four long years
it lasted, and the whole world looked on, amazed at
such courage and endurance.</p>

<p class="tb">Then the men who had not been killed, or who
had not died of their sufferings came marching
home again, many, alas, on crutches, and many who
knew that they were disabled for life. But <em>they
had saved their country</em>! And that was reward
enough for their heroic hearts. Though many a
widow turned her sad face away when the crowd
welcomed the returning soldiers, for she knew that
her loved one was not with them, and many little
children learned in time that their dear fathers
would never return to them.</p>

<p>War is such a terrible thing that it makes one’s
heart ache to think of it.</p>

<p>Then by and by the people said, “Our children
must grow up loving and honoring the heroic men
who gave their lives for their country.” So in villages
and towns and cities monuments were built in
honor of the men who died fighting for their country.
And one day each year was set apart to keep
fresh and green the memory of the brave soldiers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and it has been named “<span class="smcap">Decoration Day</span>,” because
on this day all the children, all over the land, are
permitted to go to the graves of the dead soldiers
and place flowers upon them.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TAXES_OF_MIDDLEBROOK">THE TAXES OF MIDDLEBROOK</h2>

<p class="author">By Ray Stannard Baker</p>

<p class="dropcap">Up above the pines on the edge to the east
the sun was rising and the air smelled of the
woods, of the warm sand of the roadsides, of the
perfect May morning. Three men in the quaint
garb of pioneer foreigners came down the lane from
the shoemaker’s house and turned into the road.
Before they had gone many paces old Peter Walling
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“There is a warning,” he said in Norwegian.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two others followed swiftly to his
pointing. In the midst of the sand a twig of willow
had been stuck. The top was split, and it held upward
a bit of soiled paper. Old Peter seemed undecided
whether to touch the message or not, but
Halstrom, the shoemaker, plucked it from the stick,
and scowled as he tried to make out its meaning.
Presently he handed it to his son.</p>

<p>“What does it say, Eric?” he asked.</p>

<p>The message was in English, printed with a lumberman’s
coarse pencil, and a rude attempt had
been made to draw a skull and cross-bones at the
top of the paper. Eric read it slowly, translating
into Norwegian as he went along:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be Ware! All <span class="smcap">Norwegans</span> and <span class="smcap">Sweeds</span> are hereby <span class="smcapuc">WARNED</span>
not to go to the Town Hall under <span class="smcapuc">PENALTY</span> of <span class="smcapuc">DEATH</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was signed in big letters, “By Order of the
Committee.”</p>

<p>Eric Halstrom looked up and laughed shortly.
“Well,” he said, “it means us,” and he tucked the
message away with some care in his pocket.</p>

<p>“We may need it,” he added.</p>

<p>The two older men were silent for a moment.
Then Peter Walling spoke faintly: “If there is
going to be trouble—if there is danger—”</p>

<p>The old shoemaker straightened his bent shoulders
and his eyes flashed angrily. “Peter Walling,
will you go or will you stay? I thought we had
settled this question once for all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, Jens—yes, yes, I’ll go,” answered Walling,
hurriedly, but his lips protested under his
beard.</p>

<p>Halstrom turned without a word and hobbled
down the road, determination speaking from every
nervous hitch of his twisted frame. He was small
and crippled, and in all his life he had never been
able to do the work of a strong man. But there was
that in his blue eyes which made him a leader in
Thingvalla. He had cobbled in the old country,
and he had cobbled in this new Northwest among
the pines, and every peg he drove had clinched a
thought. He was not educated in English; he had
emigrated too late for that, but he had seen to it
that his son made the best of the scant schooling of
a new land, and better still, he had taught him some
of the wisdom that comes to a cobbler who thinks.</p>

<p>Eric stood almost six feet tall. His hair was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
yellow and curly as a rope end, and his eyes were
blue and steady. Although barely twenty years
old, he had learned by the hard knocks of a pioneer
country how to take care of himself, both with his
big right arm and with his tongue.</p>

<p>Over ten miles of sand-hills and corduroy,
through vast forests of pine as yet barely notched
with the clearings of settlers, the three men came at
last in sight of the town hall, the shoemaker and his
son in front, and old Peter Walling behind, muttering
his fears. The town hall was a log shack,
one story high, with a single large room.</p>

<p>As the three approached, they could see that the
road was full of men and teams. The men were
moving about, and talking with the boisterous
pleasantry of backwoodsmen who do not often meet.
They had gathered this spring morning for the annual
session of the board of review—the board that
was to make the final equalization of the taxes on
the property of the township. Eric looked anxiously
to see if there were any others present from
the Thingvalla settlement, or, indeed, any Scandinavians,
but he could not see even one.</p>

<p>“They are all afraid,” the shoemaker said, bitterly.
“They have come to a free country, and they
don’t know how to be free.”</p>

<p>But the New Antrim settlement was out in force.
Eric heard the jolly voices of the young Irishmen,
and he knew well that they were spoiling for a fight.
Thingvalla was in one corner of the township, New
Antrim was in the other, and between the settlements
stretched unbroken forests of pine and implacable
bitterness. It was one of those settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
differences so common in the backwoods, and the
more unfortunate for being unfounded. New Antrim
was sure that Thingvalla was trying to control
the township, and Thingvalla was equally sure that
New Antrim was escaping its share of taxation.
And that was the condition on this bright May day,
when the three from Thingvalla came down with
the warning in Eric’s pocket.</p>

<p>“They are too many!” muttered old Peter Walling,
tremulously.</p>

<p>They saw Calvin Donohue and his men sporting
in the sunshine. Donohue was the man in the otter
cap, immensely broad and brawny of shoulders,
long of arms and square of chin. He talked in a
big, jolly voice; from where they stood they could
hear him laugh.</p>

<p>O’Rourke, Callahan and some of the younger
men were trying their strength on a huge iron soap-kettle
that stood in front of the blacksmith shop.
They were testing their muscles to see which could
lift it from the ground with one hand. There were
few who could do it, but Calvin Donohue put it
as high as his shoulder as if it were only a feather.
Others were pitching quoits with horseshoes, and
one group was watching a pulling contest between
O’Rourke and Davy, who were sitting, feet to feet
on the ground, tugging on a crowbar.</p>

<p>The shoemaker, who had been resting by the
roadside, now rose, and without a word set off
down the hill toward the crowd, with his chin
thrown up and his eyes looking neither to the right
nor to the left.</p>

<p>The moment the men of New Antrim saw them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a gleeful shout went up. Here was new sport for
them. A powerful man in a lumberman’s red
jacket seized a heavy oak swingletree from the
blacksmith’s door, sprang out into the road, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Come on, boys, we’ve got ’em!”</p>

<p>Eric and his father did not stop, but old Peter
Walling wavered, then turned and ran back up the
road as fast as his legs could carry him. It was two
against thirty, but the two stood their ground.
While they were exchanging challenges, a man opportunely
stepped from the doorway of the town
hall and began to rap on the logs with a stake,
announcing that the board had been called to order.</p>

<p>At once there was a rush for the benches, and
Eric and his father reached the door without opposition.</p>

<p>The shoemaker made as if to enter, but Jim
O’Rourke barred the door with his arm.</p>

<p>“No Swedes admitted,” he said, gruffly.</p>

<p>The shoemaker, paying no attention to the order,
again endeavored to enter. He was thrown back
violently, and if it had not been for Eric, he would
have fallen. The shoemaker tried to speak, but
his English was hopelessly confused and broken.
Eric was white to the lips, but he controlled
himself.</p>

<p>“We are citizens of this township,” he said, “and
we have a right in this meeting.”</p>

<p>“Go wan!” was the answer. “We won’t have any
foreigners here.”</p>

<p>“We are as much Americans as you are!” responded
Eric, hotly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be cool,” cautioned the shoemaker, in his native
tongue.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Jim O’Rourke,” continued Eric, more
steadily, “there’s no need of our quarrelling this
way, and if you’d let us explain we’d show you why
we should all be friends—”</p>

<p>“Friends! Let me give you a friendly hint. You
get out of here double-quick.”</p>

<p>By nature the Scandinavian is peaceable. He
hates fighting as much as he loves his home; and yet,
for being slow to wrath, he is the more terrible when
roused. Eric took one step forward and drove up
O’Rourke’s arm with a stinging blow that sent him
spinning into the room. Then he and his father entered.
O’Rourke, recovering himself, rushed upon
Eric and dealt him a terrific blow in the breast. The
two men were just closing in a desperate encounter
when Caxton, the chairman, rose, ordering silence
and preparing to enforce his decree with a stout oak
stake.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble here?” he demanded, when
quiet had been restored.</p>

<p>“We are citizens of this township,” said Eric,
panting, “and we have a right to attend this meeting.
This man tried to shut us out.”</p>

<p>Caxton paused a moment.</p>

<p>“Put out the Norsks!” roared a voice.</p>

<p>“No,” said Caxton. “They have a right to be
here and to be heard on the subject of their taxes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Eric, eagerly. “I want to
explain—”</p>

<p>“You will be given a chance in due time,” was
the answer, given so coldly that it indicated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
chairman’s position against them beyond a doubt.
There were many whispered threats, but Eric and
his father firmly stood their ground. The business
of the board of review is to hear the complaints
of those who think they have been unfairly taxed.
Apparently there were to be few complaints at this
meeting. An old man who spoke with the unmistakable
inflection of the Irishman commended the
assessment and praised the assessor. He thought
every one in the township had been satisfied. He
was pleased to know that this was so. As he sat
down, a small, loosely jointed man, with fiery red
hair, rose from his chair.</p>

<p>He wore a diamond shirt-stud which, if genuine,
would have purchased every stitch of personal apparel
in the room. He drawled pleasantly in his
talk. Every one knew him. His name was William
P. Ketchum, or more familiarly, Billy Ketchum.
Eric’s eyes fastened hard upon him and watched
him as a catamount might watch a squirrel, and
with much the same motive.</p>

<p>Billy Ketchum was the representative of the
great logging concern of Miller, Knees &amp; Dye,
which owned all the pine lands in the township, and,
indeed, in nearly all the county. He complimented
the assessor in his softest manner, he complimented
the board down from Caxton to Severn, through
Holt, and then he complimented them up again
from Severn to Caxton. He mentioned New Antrim
and brought in a deft reference to the shamrock
and the old sod, and then—he suddenly caught
the eye of Eric Halstrom burning at him above the
heads of the crowd. For a single instant he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trying to pull himself together, and then he went
on with his pleasant drawl:</p>

<p>“As representing the largest taxpayers in Middlebrook,”
he said, “I am deeply interested in its
welfare. We pay our taxes gladly, knowing that
they have been honestly levied and that they will
be honestly collected—”</p>

<p>At this Eric Halstrom came shouldering nearer,
with the shoemaker close behind him.</p>

<p>“It’s not so!” Eric gasped, excitedly. “I tell
you it’s not so. He’s the man who’s caused all the
trouble.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware,” put in Billy Ketchum, in his
smoothest voice, “that you allowed your meetings
to be broken up by a brawling—”</p>

<p>His last words were drowned in shouts, and it
was some moments before Mr. Caxton, pounding
on the table, could restore peace.</p>

<p>Calvin Donohue whispered in the chairman’s ear,
and Mr. Caxton said aloud to Eric, “We’ll hear
what you have to say right away.”</p>

<p>The shoemaker pushed Eric forward eagerly.
The boy stood up before the crowd, blushing and
stammering. His big hands fumbled in his pockets
and his tongue refused to stir. He had not been
particularly afraid to face the assembled forces of
New Antrim in the road, but he was afraid to make
a speech.</p>

<p>“I—I wanted to—explain about the taxes,” he
stammered.</p>

<p>“So I suppose,” was Mr. Caxton’s cool reply.</p>

<p>Eric pulled a piece of chalk out of his pocket and
looked round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I’ve got to have something to write on,” he
said, at which the New Antrimites shouted with
laughter.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the wise old shoemaker at
that moment, Eric would have been lost, laughed
to defeat. Nothing will floor a speaker more quickly
than the wit of an Irish audience. But the shoemaker
spoke in Norwegian. Eric turned quickly;
he was only a step from the door. There, outside
in the sand, stood the old iron kettle. He stooped,
picked it up, and set it on a bench, which the shoemaker
had swung into place. It was all done so
swiftly that New Antrim forgot its fun in its astonishment.</p>

<p>And when Eric drew a big white square on the
kettle with his chalk, a voice rose hoarsely from
the back of the room:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!”</p>

<p>At that all the Irishmen laughed, and then sat
still again, out of respect, being “jiggered.”</p>

<p>Eric divided the white square into many smaller
squares. In one corner he drew a number of
crosses; in the opposite corner he did the same. One
of these groups of crosses he labeled T.</p>

<p>“That is the Thingvalla settlement,” he said,
“and this—is New Antrim.”</p>

<p>Then he swept his hand between the two and
glanced at Billy Ketchum. “And all this in here
is the pine owned by Miller, Knees &amp; Dye.”</p>

<p>The shoemaker whispered in his ear, and he
turned to the chairman, and said in a sterner voice:
“I want to show who is to blame for all this trouble
between the settlements.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are not dealing with quarrels,” was the response.
“We are here to equalize taxes.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s what I want to do. I want to
show that the taxes aren’t equal.”</p>

<p>Then he fumbled in his pocket and drew out a
much-folded paper. With this to support him, he
forgot all about himself, and talked rapidly and
earnestly.</p>

<p>He told how he had figured up all the land
owned by the Scandinavians of Thingvalla, and
all that owned by New Antrim, and all that owned
by the lumber company.</p>

<p>“Thingvalla has two thousand two hundred and
forty acres in farms; New Antrim has two thousand
nine hundred and twenty acres,” he explained,
“while the lumber company has more than twelve
thousand acres of pine. Thingvalla is assessed at
an average of four dollars and sixty cents an acre;
New Antrim is assessed at four dollars and fifteen
cents an acre—a little less, but not enough to count.
But here is this lumber company assessed for only
one dollar and ninety cents an acre—”</p>

<p>Here Billy Ketchum sprang excitedly to his feet.
“But this is wild land—not a foot of it is cultivated.
I tell you such a comparison is unfair—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but your pine is worth more to the acre
than our farms with all our crops and buildings on
them.”</p>

<p>“I tell you—”</p>

<p>“I know!” broke in Eric, excitedly. “I tell you,
I know! Look here—”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a pack of little strips
of paper, each with a section map at the top, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which different “forties” of land were checked up
in red and blue pencil.</p>

<p>He turned again to the table and marked out a
square about midway between the settlements.</p>

<p>“Here’s section ten, township forty, range twelve.
Last fall I was hired to go over this land with the
company’s explorer, and estimate the pine. We
travelled together for two months, counted all the
trees, and estimated the number of feet of lumber
they would make. That pine as it stands is worth
from four dollars to six dollars a thousand feet, and
some of the single forties have more than two hundred
thousand feet of timber on them. That makes
a cash value of from eight hundred dollars to twelve
hundred dollars—or twenty dollars to thirty dollars
an acre—and that’s more than the best improved
farm in this county is worth—”</p>

<p>“I tell you—” roared little Billy Ketchum, wild
with excitement.</p>

<p>“And you know it,” added Eric. “Here are
these slips, which will prove just what I say. They
are the company’s own valuation of its property.
You can see for yourselves that our farms are assessed
for more than twice as much as this pine
land, although it is worth five or six times as much.
And that will show you who is dodging taxes. Billy
Ketchum says that he represents the biggest taxpayers
in the township, and that he is well contented
with the assessment. Of course he is contented,
but he is wrong about representing the
largest taxpayers. As the assessments now are, we
represent the biggest taxpayers—and we are not
contented, for we pay ten times the taxes that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
should. All I ask is that the assessments be fair,
and Thingvalla and New Antrim will not quarrel.”</p>

<p>Billy Ketchum, purple of face, tried in vain to
make himself heard, but the Irishmen of New Antrim
drowned him out of the discussion. The explorer’s
slips were passed back and forth and referred
to the diagram on the iron kettle, and for a
few moments pandemonium reigned.</p>

<p>“What’s more,” shouted Eric, in the flush of
victory, “I can prove that Billy Ketchum is at the
bottom of this quarrel!”</p>

<p>There was silence again.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for him, we’d have been good
friends to-day. He’s kept us enemies so that we
couldn’t get together and assess the pine lands as
they ought to be assessed.”</p>

<p>Ketchum sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“It’s not so!” he shouted. “We’ve been perfectly
fair to every one. Why should I mix up in neighborhood
quarrels?”</p>

<p>He poured out an impassioned speech, the drawl
all gone, and the words crowding so fast that he
could hardly utter them plainly. He called the
Irishmen “Billy” and “Calvin” and “Pete” familiarly,
and spoke of their warm friendship, but
somehow they did not rouse to enthusiasm as he
had expected. They were thinking.</p>

<p>Presently Eric made himself heard again.</p>

<p>“Who left that warning in the Thingvalla road
last night?” he asked, facing Ketchum.</p>

<p>“Who? How should I know?”</p>

<p>At this, New Antrim leaned forward to a man
with curiosity. Eric drew out the warning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
told where he had found it. Then he passed it
gravely to Mr. Caxton.</p>

<p>“Billy Ketchum left that in the road,” said
Eric. “He did it to keep us away from the
meeting. He tried to make us think that the
New Antrim settlement was against us. He had
found out that I knew the real value of those
pine lands.”</p>

<p>Again Billy hopped up. “I dare him to prove
it, Mr. Chairman! I didn’t come here to be insulted.
I tell you—I dare him to prove it!”</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” said Eric, coolly.</p>

<p>At that the shoemaker stepped round behind the
table and picked up a long, slender, paper-covered
roll and handed it to Eric. Eric held it up, and
pointed to Ketchum’s name written upon it, for it
was a roll of maps. Ketchum rushed at Eric and
tried to grasp his property, but Eric brushed him
aside.</p>

<p>Then he unrolled the manila covering of the
maps a few inches and held it up. One corner was
torn off. He took the warning notice from Mr.
Caxton’s desk and held it in the place of this torn
corner. It fitted perfectly.</p>

<p>“My father happened to see this when he came
in,” explained Eric. “What more proof do you
want?”</p>

<p>For a moment the room was still. Then the
same deep voice which had spoken once before
burst out:</p>

<p>“I’ll be jiggered!”</p>

<p>Calvin Donohue turned to Billy Ketchum and
said, none too pleasantly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“You get out! We can manage our own affairs!”</p>

<p>Callahan suggested taking him out triumphantly
in the iron kettle, but Billy disappeared with such
haste they could not catch him.</p>

<p>Then the whole assembly took up seriously the
problem of assessments, and before the day was
out, the township of Middlebrook was equalized,
and the taxes of the settlers, New Antrim and
Thingvalla alike, were cut down to their just proportions,
no more, no less, and the pine lands were
assessed strictly in accordance with Eric’s estimate
slips.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CURE_OF_FEAR">THE CURE OF FEAR</h2>

<p class="author">By Norman Duncan</p>

<p class="dropcap">Like many another snug little harbor on the
northeast coast of Newfoundland, Ruddy
Cove is confronted by the sea and flanked by a vast
wilderness; so all the folk take their living from the
sea, as their forebears have done for generations.</p>

<p>It takes courage and a will for work to sweeten
the hard life of those parts, which otherwise would
be filled with dread and an intolerable weariness;
and Donald North, of Ruddy Cove, was brave
enough till he was eight years old. But after that
season he was so timid that he shrank from the edge
of the cliffs when the breakers were beating the
rocks below, and he trembled when the punt heeled
to a gust.</p>

<p>Now he was a fisherman’s son, and in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of things must himself be a paddle-punt fisherman;
thus the mishap which gave him that great fear of
the sea cast a dark shadow over him.</p>

<p>“Billy,” he said to young Topsail, on the unfortunate
day, “leave us go sail my new fore-an’-after.
I’ve rigged her out with a grand new
mizzens’l.”</p>

<p>“Sure, b’y!” said Billy. “Where to?”</p>

<p>“Uncle George’s wharf-head. ’Tis a place as
good as any.”</p>

<p>Off Uncle George’s wharf-head the water was
deep—deeper than Donald could fathom at low
tide—and it was cold, and covered a rocky bottom,
upon which a multitude of starfish and prickly sea-eggs
lay in clusters. It was green, smooth and
clear, too; sight carried straight down to where the
purple-shelled mussels gripped the rocks.</p>

<p>The tide had fallen somewhat and was still on the
ebb. Donald found it a long reach from the wharf
to the water. By and by, as the water ran out of the
harbor, the most he could do was to touch the mast
tip of the miniature ship with his fingers. Then a
little gust of wind crept round the corner of the
wharf, rippling the water as it came near. It
caught the sails of the new fore-and-after, and the
little craft fell over on another tack and shot
away.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” Donald cried. “Come back, will
you?”</p>

<p>He reached for the mast. His fingers touched
it, but the boat escaped before they closed. He
laughed, hitched nearer to the edge of the wharf,
and reached again. The wind had failed; the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
boat was tossing in the ripples, below and just beyond
his grasp.</p>

<p>“I can’t cotch her!” he called to Billy Topsail,
who was back near the net-horse, looking for squids.</p>

<p>Billy looked up, and laughed to see Donald’s
awkward position—to see him hanging over the
water, red-faced and straining. Donald laughed,
too. At once he lost his balance and fell forward.</p>

<p>This was in the days before he could swim, so he
floundered about in the water, beating it wildly, to
bring himself to the surface. When he came up,
Billy Topsail was leaning over to catch him. Donald
lifted his arm. His fingers touched Billy’s, that
was all—just touched them. Then he sank; and
when he came up again, and again lifted his arm,
there was half a foot of space between his hand and
Billy’s. Some measure of self-possession returned.
He took a long breath, and let himself sink. Down
he went, weighted by his heavy boots.</p>

<p>Those moments were full of the terror of which,
later, he could not rid himself. There seemed to
be no end to the depth of the water in that place.
But when his feet touched bottom, he was still deliberate
in all that he did.</p>

<p>For a moment he let them rest on the rock. Then
he gave himself a strong upward push. It needed
but little to bring him within reach of Billy Topsail’s
hand. He shot out of the water and caught
that hand. Soon afterward he was safe on the
wharf.</p>

<p>“Sure, mum, I thought I was drownded that
time!” he said to his mother, that night. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I were goin’ down the last time I thought I’d never
see you again.”</p>

<p>“But you wasn’t drownded, b’y,” said his mother,
softly.</p>

<p>“But I might ha’ been,” said he.</p>

<p>There was the rub. He was haunted by what
might have happened. Soon he became a timid,
shrinking lad, utterly lacking confidence in the
strength of his arms and his skill with an oar and
a sail; and after that came to pass, his life was
hard. He was afraid to go out to the fishing-grounds,
where he must go every day with his
father to keep the head of the punt up to the wind,
and he had a great fear of the wind and the fog and
the breakers.</p>

<p>But he was not a coward. On the contrary, although
he was circumspect in all his dealings with
the sea, he never failed in his duty.</p>

<p class="tb">In Ruddy Cove all the men put out their salmon-nets
when the ice breaks up and drifts away southward,
for the spring run of salmon then begins.
These nets are laid in the sea, at right angles to the
rocks and extending out from them; they are set
alongshore, it may be a mile or two, from the narrow
passage to the harbor. The outer end is
buoyed and anchored, and the other is lashed to an
iron stake which is driven deep into some crevice of
the rock.</p>

<p>When belated icebergs hang offshore a watch
must be kept on the nets, lest they be torn away or
ground to pulp by the ice.</p>

<p>“The wind’s haulin’ round a bit, b’y,” said Donald’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
father, one day in spring, when the lad was
twelve years old. “I think ’twill freshen and blow
inshore afore night.”</p>

<p>“They’s a scattered pan of ice out there, father,”
said Donald, “and three small bergs.”</p>

<p>“Iss, b’y, I knows,” said North. “’Tis that I’m
afeared of. If the wind changes a bit more, ’twill
jam the ice agin the rocks. Does you think the net
is safe?”</p>

<p>It was quite evident that the net was in danger,
but since Donald had first shown signs of fearing
the sea, Job North had not compelled him to go out
upon perilous undertakings. He had fallen into the
habit of leaving the boy to choose his own course,
believing that in time he would master himself.</p>

<p>“I think, zur,” said Donald, steadily, “the net
should come in.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be wise,” said North. “Come, b’y,
we’ll go fetch it.”</p>

<p>So they put forth in the punt. There was a fair,
fresh wind, and with this filling the little brown
sail, they were soon driven out from the quiet water
of the harbor to the heaving sea itself. Great swells
rolled in from the open and broke furiously against
the coast rocks.</p>

<p>The punt ran alongshore for two miles keeping
well away from the breakers. When at last she
came to that point where Job North’s net was set,
Donald furled the sail and his father took up the
oars.</p>

<p>“’Twill be a bit hard to land,” he said.</p>

<p>Therein lay the danger. There is no beach
along that coast. The rocks rise abruptly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the sea—here, sheer and towering; there, low and
broken.</p>

<p>When there is a sea running, the swells roll in
and break against these rocks; and when the
breakers catch a punt, they are certain to smash
it to splinters.</p>

<p>The iron stake to which Job North’s net was
lashed was fixed in a low ledge, upon which some
hardy shrubs had taken root. The waves were casting
themselves against the rocks below, breaking
with a great roar and flinging spray over the ledge.</p>

<p>“’Twill be a bit hard,” North said again.</p>

<p>But the salmon-fishers have a way of landing
under such conditions. When their nets are in danger
they do not hesitate. The man at the oars lets
the boat drift with the breakers stern foremost
toward the rocks. His mate leaps from the stern
seat to the ledge. Then the other pulls the boat out
of danger before the wave curls and breaks. It
is the only way.</p>

<p>But sometimes the man in the stem miscalculates—leaps
too soon, stumbles, leaps short. He falls
back, and is almost inevitably drowned. Sometimes,
too, the current of the wave is too strong for
the man at the oars; his punt is swept in, pull as
hard as he may, and he is overwhelmed with her.
Donald knew all this. He had lived in dread of the
time when he must first make that leap.</p>

<p>“The ice is comin’ in, b’y,” said North. “’Twill
scrape these here rocks, certain sure. Does you
think you’re strong enough to take the oars an’ let
me go ashore?”</p>

<p>“No, zur,” said Donald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“You never leaped afore, did you?”</p>

<p>“No, zur.”</p>

<p>“Will you try it now, b’y?” said North quietly.</p>

<p>“Iss, zur,” Donald said, faintly.</p>

<p>“Get ready, then,” said North.</p>

<p>With a stroke or two of the oars Job swung the
stem of the boat to the rocks. He kept her hanging
in this position until the water fell back and
gathered in a new wave; then he lifted his oars.
Donald was crouched on the stern seat, waiting for
the moment to rise and spring.</p>

<p>The boat moved in, running on the crest of the
wave which would a moment later break against the
rock. Donald stood up, and fixed his eye on the
ledge. He was afraid; all the strength and courage
he had seemed to desert him. The punt was
now almost on a level with the ledge. The wave
was about to curl and fall. It was the precise moment
when he must leap—that instant, too, when
the punt must be pulled out of the grip of the
breaker, if at all.</p>

<p>He felt of a sudden that he <em>must</em> do this thing.
Therefore why not do it courageously? He leaped;
but this new courage had not come in time. He
made the ledge, but he fell an inch short of a firm
footing. So for a moment he tottered, between
falling forward and falling back. Then he caught
the branch of an overhanging shrub, and with this
saved himself. When he turned, Job had the punt
in safety; but he was breathing hard, as if the strain
had been great.</p>

<p>“’Twas not so hard, was it, b’y?” said Job.</p>

<p>“No, zur,” said Donald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Donald cast the net line loose from its mooring,
and saw that it was all clear. His father let the
punt sweep in again. It is much easier to leap from
a solid rock than from a boat, so Donald jumped
in without difficulty. Then they rowed out to the
buoy and hauled the great, dripping net over the
side.</p>

<p>It was well they went out, for before morning
the ice had drifted over the place where the net had
been. More than that, Donald North profited by
his experience. He perceived that if perils must
be encountered, they are best met with a clear head
and an unflinching heart.</p>

<p>That night, when he thought it over, he was comforted.</p>

<p class="tb">In the gales and high seas of the summer following,
and in the blinding snowstorms and bitter
cold of the winter, Donald North grew in fine readiness
to face peril at the call of duty. All that he
had gained was put to the test in the next spring,
when the floating ice, which drifts out of the north
in the spring break-up, was driven by the wind
against the coast.</p>

<p>Job North, with Alexander Bludd and Bill Stevens,
went out on the ice to hunt seal, and the hunt
led them ten miles offshore. In the afternoon of
that day the wind gave some sign of changing to
the west, and at dusk it was blowing half a gale
offshore. When the wind blows offshore it sweeps
all this wandering ice out to sea, and disperses the
whole pack.</p>

<p>“Go see if your father’s comin’, b’y,” said Donald’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
mother. “I’m gettin’ terrible nervous about
the ice.”</p>

<p>Donald took his gaff—a long pole of the light,
tough dogwood, two inches thick and shod with
iron—and set out. It was growing dark, and the
wind, rising still, was blowing in strong, cold gusts.
It began to snow while he was yet on the ice of the
harbor, half a mile away from the pans and clumpers
which the wind of the day before had crowded
against the coast.</p>

<p>When he came to the “standing ice,”—the stationary
rim of ice which is frozen to the coast,—the
wind was thickly charged with snow. What
with dusk and snow, he found it hard to keep to
the right way. But he was not afraid for himself;
his only fear was that the wind would sweep the
ice-pack out to sea before his father reached the
“standing edge.” In that event, as he knew, Job
North would be doomed.</p>

<p>Donald went out on the standing edge. Beyond
lay a widening gap of water. The pack had already
begun to move out.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Job North’s party. The
lad ran up and down, hallooing as he ran; but for
a time there was no answer to his call. Then it
seemed to him he heard a despairing hail, sounding
far to the right, whence he had come. Night had
almost fallen, and the snow added to its depth; but
as he ran back, Donald could still see across the
gap of water to that great pan of ice, which, of all
the pack, was nearest to the standing edge. He
perceived that the gap had considerably widened
since he had first observed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that you, father?” he called.</p>

<p>“Iss, Donald!” came an answering hail from
directly opposite. “Is there a small pan of ice on
your side?”</p>

<p>Donald searched up and down the edge for a
detached cake large enough for his purpose. Near
at hand he came upon a thin, small pan, not more
than six feet square.</p>

<p>“Haste, b’y!” cried his father.</p>

<p>“They’s one here,” he called back, “but ’tis too
small! Is there none there?”</p>

<p>“No, b’y! Fetch that over!”</p>

<p>Here was a desperate need. If the lad was to
meet it, he must act instantly and fearlessly. He
stepped out on the pan, and pushed off with his
gaff.</p>

<p>Using his gaff as a paddle—as these gaffs are
constantly used in ferrying by the Newfoundland
fishermen—and helped by the wind, he soon
ferried himself to where Job North stood waiting
with his companions.</p>

<p>“’Tis too small,” said Stevens. “’Twill not hold
two.”</p>

<p>North looked dubiously at the pan. Alexander
Bludd shook his head in despair.</p>

<p>“Get back while you can, b’y,” said North.
“Quick! We’re driftin’ fast. The pan’s too small.”</p>

<p>“I think ’tis big enough for one man and me,”
said Donald.</p>

<p>“Get aboard and try it, Alexander,” said Job.</p>

<p>Alexander Bludd stepped on. The pan tipped
fearfully, and the water ran over it; but when the
weight of the man and the boy was properly adjusted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
it seemed capable of bearing them both
across. They pushed off.</p>

<p>When Alexander moved to put his gaff in the
water the pan tipped again. Donald came near
losing his footing. He moved nearer the edge, and
the pan came to a level. They paddled with all
their strength, for the wind was blowing against
them, and there was need of haste if three passages
were to be made. Meanwhile the gap had grown
so wide that the wind had turned the ripples into
waves, which washed over the pan as high as Donald’s
ankles.</p>

<p>But they came safe across. Bludd stepped quickly
ashore, and Donald pushed off. With the wind
in his favor, he was soon once more at the other
side.</p>

<p>“Now, Bill,” said North, “your turn next.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, Job,” said Stevens. “Get aboard
yourself. The lad can’t come back again. We’re
driftin’ out too fast. He’s your lad, an’ you’ve the
right to—”</p>

<p>“Iss, I can come back,” said Donald. “Come on,
Bill! Quick!”</p>

<p>Stevens was a lighter man than Alexander
Bludd, but the passage was wider, and still widening,
for the pack had gathered speed.</p>

<p>When Stevens was safely landed, he looked
back.</p>

<p>A vast white shadow was all that he could see.
Job North’s figure had been merged with the night.</p>

<p>“Donald, b’y,” he said, “you got to go back for
your father, but I’m fair feared you’ll never—”</p>

<p>“Give me a push, Bill,” said Donald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Stevens caught the end of the gaff and pushed
the lad out.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Donald!” he said.</p>

<p>When the pan touched the other side, Job North
stepped aboard without a word. He was a heavy
man. With his great body on the ice-cake, the
problem of return was enormously increased, as
Donald had foreseen.</p>

<p>The pan was overweighted. Time and again it
nearly shook itself free of its bad load and rose to
the surface.</p>

<p>North stood near the center, plying his gaff with
difficulty, but Donald was on the extreme edge.
Moreover, the distance was twice as great as it had
been at the first, and the waves were running high,
and it was dark.</p>

<p>They made way slowly, and the pan often wavered
beneath them; but Donald was intent upon
the thing he was doing, and he was not afraid.</p>

<p>Then came the time—they were but ten yards off
the standing edge—when North struck his gaff too
deep into the water. He lost his balance, struggled
desperately to regain it, failed—and fell off. Before
Donald was awake to the danger, the edge of
the pan sank under him, and he, too, toppled off.</p>

<p>Donald had learned to swim now. When he
came to the surface, his father was breast-high in
the water, looking for him.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Donald?” said his father.</p>

<p>“Iss, zur.”</p>

<p>“Can you reach the ice alone?”</p>

<p>“Iss, zur,” said Donald quietly.</p>

<p>Alexander Bludd and Bill Stevens helped them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
up on the standing edge, and they were home by
the kitchen fire in half an hour.</p>

<p>“’Twas bravely done, b’y,” said Job.</p>

<p>So Donald North learned that perils feared are
much more terrible than perils faced. He has a
courage of the finest kind, in these days, has young
Donald.</p>

<h2 id="A_CHRISTMAS_ADVENTURE">A CHRISTMAS ADVENTURE</h2>

<p class="author">By J. E. Chamberlin</p>

<p class="dropcap">Having lived all his fourteen years in New
York City, making occasional visits to his
grandfather’s house in Connecticut, Horace Mason
had often sighed for an adventure, and lamented
because life in the eastern part of the country is so
tame and uninteresting. It had certainly never
occurred to him that the chance for a pretty thrilling
adventure existed in the quiet country neighborhood
in which his grandfather lived.</p>

<p>About a week before Christmas Horace’s mother
took him to his grandfather’s farm for the holidays—he
had seldom been there in winter.</p>

<p>The weather became remarkably cold and rough,
but Horace found pleasure in walking about woods
and pastures in rubber boots and ulster, and noting
how odd the familiar scenes looked when covered
with snow and ice, instead of dressed in green.</p>

<p>A tree was to be set up on Christmas Eve in the
old homestead; but Uncle John, on the afternoon
of the twenty-third, brought in for the celebration
a rather scraggly little red cedar, brown rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
green, which Horace deemed totally unfit for the
dignity of a Christmas celebration.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you get a fir balsam, with a nice
even top to it?” Horace asked his uncle.</p>

<p>“Don’t grow around here.”</p>

<p>“But there are some over in the Big Swamp,”
said Horace.</p>

<p>“Never noticed ’em,” said Uncle John.</p>

<p>Horace said nothing to this, because he was
aware that he had often noticed things about
the region, in the way of trees, plants and birds,
which were apparently quite unobserved by the
residents.</p>

<p>“You won’t be offended if I go after one to-morrow,
will you, Uncle John?”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, no!”</p>

<p>The next morning a blizzard raged. Horace,
looking out, saw nothing but the whirling fine
snow; the wind rattled all the shutters on the old
house; it shook the building to its very foundations.</p>

<p>Horace thought it would be great fun to go
out into this storm, with ulster, high rubber boots,
and cap over his ears, looking for a Christmas tree
in the Big Swamp. It did not occur to him that
he needed to get his mother’s permission for the
expedition, and it certainly did not occur to her
that the boy would start out in such a storm.</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast he took an ax from the
wood-shed, and was gone. On the way he thought
for a time that he must turn back—the storm buffeted
him so terribly, and the cold, in spite of his
warm coverings, was so intense. But he fought
his way along, and at last came to the borders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the swamp, a flat tract of perhaps a hundred acres,
lying in a hollow between hills.</p>

<p>In the spring this level expanse was mostly covered
with water, up through which grew many low
red maples, some scattered firs and cedars, and a
jungle of alders. Horace had often wished that he
might explore the gloomy depths of this swamp,
but in midsummer mosquitoes and pools forbade.
Now, with the ground and the pools frozen, he had
no doubt he could pass through the swamp from
end to end.</p>

<p>He left the wood road, and plowed through the
deep snow along the margin of the swamp, looking
out for firs. But he could see nothing more than a
rod or two away. The storm did not diminish, and
all about him the snow seemed extraordinarily deep.
He sank into it up to his knees, and sometimes it
was deeper still. He walked thus a long way on the
edge of the swamp woodland, not caring to plunge
into the swamp until he should have spied out a
balsam.</p>

<p>At last he saw, through the cloud of snow, the
tapering head of an unmistakable fir balsam. He
struck into the swamp after it, parting the alder
branches with the ax held with both hands before
him, and sinking two or three inches deeper into the
snow.</p>

<p>The fir proved to be too irregular for a Christmas
tree. Then, through the snow, he saw another
farther in the swamp. He penetrated to that, and
found one side of it lacking. Beyond were other
firs, and he fought his way deeper and deeper into
the swamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He discovered now a circumstance that aided
him somewhat in working his way through the
jungle. The matted alders seemed to lean away in
masses from the hummocks of earth upon which
they grew, in such a way as to make crooked arched-over
passageways, which, Horace thought, were
curiously like the paths moles make under matted
grass. He had often amused himself in summer
digging out these mole-paths, and wondering why
the crooked ways were constructed.</p>

<p>These avenues through the alder thickets, away
down in the bottom of a swamp quite impenetrable
without them, often came to an abrupt end. Then
Horace, floundering on hands and knees in the deep
snow, sometimes thrusting his foot down into a
watery depth, had to break his way with his
ax through to another opening.</p>

<p>He found the seclusion somewhat interesting.
Down here there was no wind, and his clothing and
his laborious exercise made him warm—even uncomfortably
so. He lay a few minutes on his back,
in a place where he could look up through an opening
in the branches, and marveled at the sight of the
stormy maelstrom overhead.</p>

<p>The whirling snow looked black. For a moment
the current of it seemed flowing like a river all one
way; then it appeared to turn, to cross itself, and to
twist about in a circle, from which it soon disentangled
itself, to resume its swift and steady march
in one direction.</p>

<p>All at once it occurred to Horace to ask himself,
Which direction was that? He thought first that
he could not get lost in the swamp so long as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
could see which way the snow was driving; but a
chill ran over him when he reflected that he had not
noticed, in his eagerness all the morning to be out
in the storm, which way the wind was blowing. He
tried now to think which way it had come as he
walked to the swamp, but all he could recall was
that the storm seemed to be coming from all directions
at once.</p>

<p>He started up with a sudden alarm; and then,
noticing the deep track he had made as he
floundered to the place where he lay now, he began
to laugh. To get out of the swamp, he had only
to follow his tracks back.</p>

<p>He had come in here to find a nice young fir for
a Christmas tree, and he was bound to get one. As
he sat up, preparatory to rising, he saw that the
snow, sifting down straight and steady from the
eddying masses above the tops of the alders, had
covered his coat and trousers with a deposit half an
inch thick. And the minute of inaction had made
him feel cold and stiff. He must be stirring.</p>

<p>He plowed along farther into the swamp. Coming
out on the surface of one of the pools, he was
rejoiced to see some balsam tops that seemed not
more than a rod or two from the other edge of the
pool. He struck through to them, but found here
not even a mole-path; he had to cut and slash with
his ax to get to the trunks of the firs.</p>

<p>Although the butts were five or six inches thick,
the tops seemed tapering and even, and he set about
cutting down one of the trees. Very soon he had
the trunk cut in two, and it settled down into the
snow; but fall it certainly could not, so dense was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the growth all about it. He had to drag the butt
through the bushes, still fighting his way with the
ax, until the tree lay nearly flat on the ground; and
then he found that the shape did not suit him at all.</p>

<p>He left this fir on the ground and went plowing
after another.</p>

<p>Before long, traversing one of the tunnels under
the alders, he came upon the very fir he wanted—a
beautiful, even little tree, thick and green. He
cut it down eagerly; but in another moment he
found that it was as impracticable to drag that
bushy-headed young tree through the alder jungle
as it would have been to move a house through the
same wilderness. Horace had literally to carve a
way for it. He slashed and chopped and worked
the tree along a rod or two, and this took him at
least half an hour.</p>

<p>Horace sat down, quite out of breath, on the butt
of the little tree to think it over. How could he get
the tree out? He pondered a good while, and began
to feel very cold, and then looked up to see if
the storm was still raging violently. It certainly
was. The space above the treetops was black with
clouds of snow.</p>

<p>Then, chancing to look away in the direction from
which he had come, he noticed that his tracks were
already filled with snow! Horace jumped up, quite
willing to leave his Christmas tree behind, and dragging
his ax, rushed through the tunnel toward the
pool that he had crossed less than an hour before.
The track disappeared completely before he had
reached this small open space. Although the alder
branches were so thick, they held up very little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the snow. Leafless and wiry, they afforded little
surface for the hard snow to cling to.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Horace found his way to the pool,
and there the storm struck him full in the face. It
was blinding. He could no longer see the fir tops
that had beckoned him on an hour ago! Every
track that he had made in coming in was completely
obliterated!</p>

<p>Perhaps if he beat round the outskirts of the pool
he could find the tracks where he came in, among
the bushes on the other side. So he began to walk
round and round the little open space, searching in
vain for the tracks, and finding nothing but those
by which he had just come out of the alders where
he had cut the tree; and even these tracks were
rapidly being covered.</p>

<p>He began to feel decidedly queer, for he had not
the slightest idea now which was the way out of the
swamp. But he must be able to reach some place
where he could see the woods; and once out of the
swamp and into these, he could easily enough find
his way back to the house.</p>

<p>So for more than an hour—it seemed longer to
him, but he had left his watch at home, and had
no way of telling the time—he dragged himself
through the tunnels under the alders, or slashed to
right and left with his ax. He struggled and grew
desperate, and never once did he catch sight of anything
that looked like the woods or the margin of
the swamp.</p>

<p>The snow grew deeper and deeper, and made the
arching tops of his mole-paths lower and lower,
while the labor of floundering and dragging himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
through them became more terrible. Once he felt
a thrill of relief upon coming on a track which he
knew must be his own. He supposed that it was
the track by which he had come into the jungle in
the morning, strangely left uncovered by some better
protection than the thicket had provided elsewhere.
So he started back on it quite joyfully.
And he followed it until he came to the trunk of
a little maple-tree which he knew he had cut down
not fifteen minutes before to clear a path.</p>

<p>Then he knew he was winding about and had
crossed his own tracks. If he followed them farther,
they would simply bring him back to where he
stood now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had grown very faint—he was almost
too badly scared to be aware that he
was hungry.</p>

<p>But he felt that it must be afternoon; and on
such a day, and at this time of year, the darkness
would fall by half past three. He felt himself hopelessly
lost—and abandoned, too, for why did not the
people at the house miss him, and know that, having
gone after a Christmas tree, he must be lost in the
Big Swamp? Why did they not send after him?</p>

<p>They <em>must</em> come! But if he sat down and waited
for them he would get chilled. Already, in spite
of his efforts, he felt a numbness creeping over him.
The sense of it filled him with horror. He hurled
himself against the bushes; he threw himself on his
hands and knees, and worked his way through the
narrow passages. His mind went over and over
various futile schemes for tracing his way.</p>

<p>All at once he stopped and pondered. If he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
really going round in a ring when he thought he
was going straight, could it be possible that he would
go straight if he tried to go round in a ring? And
if he found his way back to his track and made a
ring, why not start out anew and deliberately add
another ring to that? Enough circles made thus,
placed side by side, would reach at last the edge
of the swamp.</p>

<p>He went back on his tracks, and was pleased to
find that the snow had not yet covered them
so deeply but that he could find the place where he
had branched off from the ring he had made.</p>

<p>Walking back on this a few steps, Horace went
off to the left, purposely intending to make another
circle and come back to this one. But after threading
and pushing his way a long time, he convinced
himself that he was not returning to it; no more
tracks did he find. Did this mean that he was now
following a straighter line, or merely that he was
making a larger circle, and going entirely round the
inner one?</p>

<p>A terrible fear of the snow and the earth came
over him, and he could not bear to get down on his
hands and knees to follow the tunnels under the
bushes. But he was too weak to fight his way upright
through the thicket. His brain reeled as he
strained his eyes for the five-hundredth time for
some sign of the trees of the woods.</p>

<p>It reeled still more when it seemed to him that
he saw something large and black and shapeless
through the gloom—some strange and threatening
object descending upon him.</p>

<p>The boy was so weak and tired and dazed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
long beating about and the everlasting swirl of the
storm above his head, that he could not bring his
reason to bear upon the consideration of the question
what this thing might be. It seemed to dash
forward at him, and the formless black mass then
divided as if it were the mouth of a crocodile, and
then it drew back; it shook angrily from side to
side; now it dashed at him again, and opened its
terrible mouth.</p>

<p>Horace felt himself swooning in horror, and he
knew that if he fainted here it would be the last of
him. Oh, why had not his mother sent for him?</p>

<p>Then a thought of shame came over him, that he
should be fainting with terror over something that
could not be real.</p>

<p>Out of this shame grew a resolution, and suddenly
the resolution mended his reason, and enabled
him to see that this terrible shapeless object was a
great pine-tree, whose dark branches were waving
and bending and opening in the storm, seen dimly
through the thick snow.</p>

<p>Then he was at the edge of the woods! He tore
through the bushes, and came out on the clear space
about the tree, and rushed up to it. He dropped
the ax and put his arms round the tree. Now he
had to pull himself together to save himself from
swooning with joy. But in another minute he felt
much better. He had no idea on which side of the
swamp he was, but that did not matter. He could
find his way well enough now.</p>

<p>After a little search, he found that he was exactly
on the opposite side of the swamp from that on
which he had gone in. And as he was skirting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
edge of it, feeling fearfully hungry as well as weak,
he saw, growing quite within his reach, a fine young
fir-tree.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that he had dropped the ax
at the foot of the pine-tree, and he had to go back
and get it before he could cut down the little tree.
But he did cut it down, and staggered home with it,
weak but triumphant.</p>

<p>He found that it was three o’clock, and his
mother was very much agitated, and Uncle John
had gone away, by the road, to the Big Swamp
about half an hour before. The boy had been so
much accustomed to going off by himself that his
mother had not worried until he had failed to return
for the midday meal. Nor had she any idea what
sort of a place the Big Swamp was.</p>

<p>When Uncle John got it through his somewhat
slow head that Horace had in all probability actually
gone there, he, too, had become alarmed, and
after slow preparations, had started. Horace had
missed him by coming home across the pastures.</p>

<p>But Uncle John was brought home in an hour
by the hired man, and as Horace felt much better
after a good meal and a rest, the tree that he had
brought was dressed, and the Christmas festival
merrily celebrated by its aid.</p>

<h2 id="CHASED_BY_THE_TRAIL">CHASED BY THE TRAIL</h2>

<p class="author">By Jack London</p>

<p class="dropcap">Walt first blinked his eyes in the light of
day in a trading post on the Yukon River.
Masters, his father, was one of those world missionaries
who are known as “pioneers,” and who
spend the years of their life in pushing outward the
walls of civilization and in planting the wilderness.
He had selected Alaska as his field of labor, and his
wife had gone with him to that land of frost and
cold.</p>

<p>Now, to be born to the moccasin and pack-strap
is indeed a hard way of entering the world, but far
harder it is to lose one’s mother while yet a child.
This was Walt’s misfortune when he was fourteen
years old.</p>

<p>He had, at different times, done deeds which few
boys get the chance to do, and he had learned to take
some pride in himself and to be unafraid. With
most people pride goeth before a fall; but not so
with Walt. His was a healthy belief in his own
strength and fitness, and knowing his limitations,
he was neither overweening nor presumptuous. He
had learned to meet reverses with the stoicism of the
Indian. Shame, to him, lay not in the failure to
accomplish, but in the failure to strive. So, when
he attempted to cross the Yukon between two ice-runs,
and was chased by the trail, he was not cast
down by his defeat.</p>

</div>

<p>The way of it was this. After passing the winter
at his father’s claim on Mazy May, he came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to an island on the Yukon and went into camp.
This was late in the spring, just before the breaking
of the ice on the river. It was quite warm, and the
days were growing marvelously long. Only the
night before, when he was talking with Chilkoot
Jim, the daylight had not faded and sent him off to
bed till after ten o’clock. Even Chilkoot Jim, an
Indian boy who was about Walt’s own age, was surprised
at the rapidity with which summer was coming
on. The snow had melted from all the southern
hillsides and the level surfaces of the flats and
islands; everywhere could be heard the trickling of
water and the song of hidden rivulets; but somehow,
under its three-foot ice-sheet, the Yukon delayed
to heave its great length of three thousand
miles and shake off the frosty fetters which bound it.</p>

<p>But it was evident that the time was fast approaching
when it would again run free. Great
fissures were splitting the ice in all directions, while
the water was beginning to flood through them and
over the top. On this morning a frightful rumbling
brought the two boys hurriedly from their blankets.
Standing on the bank, they soon discovered the
cause. The Stewart River had broken loose
and reared a great ice barrier, where it entered the
Yukon, barely a mile above their island. While a
great deal of the Stewart ice had been thus piled up,
the remainder was now flowing under the Yukon
ice, pounding and thumping at the solid surface
above it as it passed onward toward the sea.</p>

<p>“To-day um break um,” Chilkoot Jim said, nodding
his head. “Sure!”</p>

<p>“And then maybe two days for the ice to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by,” Walt added, “and you and I’ll be starting for
Dawson. It’s only seventy miles, and if the current
runs five miles an hour and we paddle three, we
ought to make it inside of ten hours. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Chilkoot Jim did not know much English,
and this favorite word of his was made to do
duty on all occasions.</p>

<p>After breakfast the boys got out the Peterborough
canoe from its winter cache. It was an admirable
sample of the boat-builder’s skill, an
imported article brought from the natural home of
the canoe—Canada. It had been packed over the
Chilkoot Pass, two years before, on a man’s back,
and had then carried the first mail in six months
into the Klondike. Walt, who happened to be in
Dawson at the time, had bought it for three hundred
dollars’ worth of dust which he had mined on the
Mazy May.</p>

<p>It had been a revelation, both to him and to Chilkoot
Jim, for up to its advent they had been used
to no other craft than the flimsy birch-bark canoes
of the Indians and the rude poling-boats of the
whites. Jim, in fact, spent many a happy half-hour
in silent admiration of its perfect lines.</p>

<p>“Um good. Sure!” Jim lifted his gaze from the
dainty craft, expressing his delight in the same
terms for the thousandth time. But glancing over
Walt’s shoulder, he saw something on the river
which startled him. “Look! See!” he cried.</p>

<p>A man had been racing a dog-team across the
slushy surface for the shore, and had been cut off
by the rising flood. As Walt whirled round to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the ice behind the man burst into violent commotion,
splitting and smashing into fragments which
bobbed up and down and turned turtle like so many
corks.</p>

<p>A gush of water followed, burying the sled and
washing the dogs from their feet. Tangled in their
harness and securely fastened to the heavy sled,
they must drown in a few minutes unless rescued
by the man. Bravely his manhood answered.</p>

<p>Floundering about with the drowning animals,
nearly hip-deep in the icy flood, he cut and slashed
with his sheath-knife at the traces. One by one the
dogs struck out for shore, the first reaching safety
ere the last was released. Then the master, abandoning
the sled, followed them. It was a struggle
in which little help could be given, and Walt and
Chilkoot Jim could only, at the last, grasp his
hands and drag him, half-fainting, up the bank.</p>

<p>First he sat down till he had recovered his breath;
next he knocked the water from his ears like a boy
who has just been swimming; and after that he
whistled his dogs together to see whether they had
all escaped. These things done, he turned his attention
to the lads.</p>

<p>“I’m Muso,” he said, “Pete Muso, and I’m looking
for Charley Drake. His partner is dying
down at Dawson, and they want him to come at
once, as soon as the river breaks. He’s got a cabin
on this island, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Walt answered, “but he’s over on the
other side of the river, with a couple of other men,
getting out a raft of logs for a grub-stake.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s disappointment was great. Exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by his weary journey, just escaped from
sudden death, overcome by all he had undergone in
carrying the message which was now useless, he
looked dazed. The tears welled into his eyes, and
his voice was choked with sobs as he repeated, aimlessly,
“But his partner’s dying. It’s his partner,
you know, and he wants to see him before he dies.”</p>

<p>Walt and Jim knew that nothing could be done,
and as aimlessly looked out on the hopeless river.
No man could venture on it and live. On the other
bank, and several miles up-stream, a thin column of
smoke wavered to the sky. Charley Drake was
cooking his dinner there; seventy miles below, his
partner lay dying; yet no word of it could be sent.</p>

<p>But even as they looked, a change came over the
river. There was a muffled rending and tearing,
and, as if by magic, the surface water disappeared,
while the great ice-sheet, reaching from shore to
shore, and broken into all manner and sizes of cakes,
floated silently up toward them. The ice which had
been pounding along underneath had evidently
grounded at some point lower down, and was now
backing up the water like a mill-dam. This had
broken the ice-sheet from the land and lifted it on
top of the rising water.</p>

<p>“Um break um very quick,” Chilkoot Jim said.</p>

<p>“Then here goes!” Muso cried, at the same time
beginning to strip his wet clothes.</p>

<p>The Indian boy laughed. “Mebbe you get um
in middle, mebbe not. All the same, the trail um
go down-stream, and you go, too. Sure!” He
glanced at Walt, that he might back him up in preventing
this insane attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re not going to try and make it across?”
Walt queried.</p>

<p>Muso nodded his head, sat down, and proceeded
to unlace his moccasins.</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t!” Walt protested. “It’s
certain death. The river’ll break before you
get half-way, and then what good’ll your message
be?”</p>

<p>But the stranger doggedly went on undressing,
muttering in an undertone, “I want Charley
Drake! Don’t you understand? It’s his partner,
dying.”</p>

<p>“Um sick man. Bimeby—” The Indian boy
put a finger to his forehead and whirled his hand in
quick circles, thus indicating the approach of brain
fever. “Um work too hard, and um think too much,
all the time think about sick man at Dawson. Very
quick um head go round—so.” And he feigned the
bodily dizziness which is caused by a disordered
brain.</p>

<p>By this time, undressed as if for a swim, Muso
rose to his feet and started for the bank. Walt
stepped in front, barring the way. He shot a glance
at his comrade. Jim nodded that he understood
and would stand by.</p>

<p>“Get out of my way, boy!” Muso commanded,
roughly, trying to thrust him aside.</p>

<p>But Walt closed in, and with the aid of Jim succeeded
in tripping him upon his back. He struggled
weakly for a few moments, but was too wearied by
his long journey to cope successfully with the two
boys whose muscles were healthy and trail-hardened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pack um into camp, roll um in plenty blanket,
and I fix um good,” Jim advised.</p>

<p>This was quickly accomplished, and the sufferer
made as comfortable as possible. After he had
been attended to, and Jim had utilized the medical
lore picked up in the camps of his own people, they
fed the stranger’s dogs and cooked dinner. They
said very little to each other, but each boy was
thinking hard, and when they went out into the sunshine
a few minutes later, their minds were intent
on the same project.</p>

<p>The river had now risen twenty feet, the ice rubbing
softly against the top of the bank. All noise
had ceased. Countless millions of tons of ice and
water were silently waiting the supreme moment,
when all bonds would be broken and the mad rush
to the sea would begin. Suddenly, without the
slightest apparent effort, everything began to move
down-stream. The jam had broken.</p>

<p>Slowly at first but faster and faster the frozen
sea dashed past. The noise returned again, and the
air trembled to a mighty churning and grinding.
Huge blocks of ice were shot into the air by the
pressure; others butted wildly into the bank; still
others, swinging and pivoting, reached inshore and
swept rows of pines away as easily as if they were
so many matches.</p>

<p>In awe-stricken silence the boys watched the
magnificent spectacle, and it was not until the ice
had slackened its speed and fallen to its old level
that Walt cried, “Look, Jim! Look at the trail
going by!”</p>

<p>And in truth it was the trail going by—the trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
upon which they had camped and traveled during
all the preceding winter. Next winter they would
journey with dogs and sleds over the same ground,
but not on the same trail. That trail, the old trail,
was passing away before their eyes.</p>

<p>Looking up-stream, they saw open water. No
more ice was coming down, although vast quantities
of it still remained on the upper reaches, jammed
somewhere amid the maze of islands which covered
the Yukon’s breast. As a matter of fact, there
were several jams yet to break, one after another,
and to send down as many ice-runs. The next
might come along in a few minutes; it might delay
for hours. Perhaps there would be time to paddle
across. Walt looked questioningly at his comrade.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Jim remarked, and without another word
they carried the canoe down the bank. Each knew
the danger of what they were about to attempt, but
they wasted no speech over it. Wild life had taught
them both that the need of things demanded effort
and action, and that the tongue found its fit vocation
at the camp-fire when the day’s work was done.</p>

<p>With dexterity born of long practice they
launched the canoe, and were soon making it spring
to each stroke of the paddles as they stemmed the
muddy current. A steady procession of lagging
ice-cakes, each thoroughly capable of crushing the
<i>Peterborough</i> like an egg-shell, was drifting on the
surface, and it required of the boys the utmost
vigilance and skill to thread them safely.</p>

<p>Anxiously they watched the great bend above,
down which at any moment might rush another ice-run.
And as anxiously they watched the ice stranded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
against the bank and towering a score of feet
above them. Cake was poised upon cake and piled
in precarious confusion, while the boys had to hug
the shore closely to avoid the swifter current of mid-stream.
Now and again great heaps of this ice
tottered and fell into the river, rolling and rumbling
like distant thunder, and lashing the water into fair-sized
tidal waves.</p>

<p>Several times they were nearly swamped, but
saved themselves by quick work with the paddles.
And all the time Charley Drake’s pillard camp
smoke grew nearer and clearer. But it was still on
the opposite shore, and they knew they must get
higher up before they attempted to shoot across.</p>

<p>Entering the Stewart River, they paddled up a
few hundred yards, shot across, and then continued
up the right hank of the Yukon. Before long they
came to the Bald-Face Bluffs—huge walls of rock
which rose perpendicularly from the river. Here
the current was swiftest inshore, forming the first
serious obstacle encountered by the boys. Below
the bluffs they rested from their exertions in a
favorable eddy, and then, paddling their strongest,
strove to dash past.</p>

<p>At first they gained, but in the swiftest place the
current overpowered them. For a full sixty seconds
they remained stationary, neither advancing nor receding,
the grim cliff base within reach of their
arms, their paddles dipping and lifting like clockwork,
and the rough water dashing by in muddy
haste. For a full sixty seconds, and then the canoe
sheered in to the shore. To prevent instant destruction,
they pressed their paddles against the rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sheered back into the stream, and were swept away.
Regaining the eddy, they stopped for breath. A
second time they attempted the passage; but just
as they were almost past, a threatening ice-cake
whirled down upon them on the angry tide, and
they were forced to flee before it.</p>

<p>“Um stiff, I think yes,” Chilkoot Jim said, mopping
the sweat from his face as they again rested
in the eddy. “Next time um make um, sure.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to. That’s all there is about it,”
Walt answered, his teeth set and lips tight-drawn,
for Pete Muso had set a bad example, and he was
almost ready to cry from exhaustion and failure.
A third time they darted out of the head of the
eddy, plunged into the swirling waters, and worked
a snail-like course ahead. Often they stood still for
the space of many strokes, but whatever they gained
they held, and they at last drew out into easier water
far above. But every moment was precious. There
was no telling when the Yukon would again become
a scene of wild anarchy in which neither man nor
any of his works could hope to endure. So they
held steadily to their course till they had passed
above Charley Drake’s camp by a quarter of a mile.
The river was fully a mile wide at this point, and
they had to reckon on being carried down by the
swift current in crossing it.</p>

<p>Walt turned his head from his place in the bow.
Jim nodded. Without further parley they headed
the canoe out from the shore, at an angle of forty-five
degrees against the current. They were on the
last stretch now; the goal was in fair sight. Indeed,
as they looked up from the toil to mark their progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they could see Charley Drake and his two comrades
come down to the edge of the river to watch
them.</p>

<p>Five hundred yards; four hundred yards; the
<i>Peterborough</i> cut the water like a blade of steel;
the paddles were dipping, dipping, dipping in rapid
rhythm—and then a warning shout from the bank
sent a chill to their hearts. Round the great bend
just above rolled a mighty wall of glistening white.
Behind it, urging it on to lightning speed, were a
million tons of long-pent water.</p>

<p>The right flank of the ice-run, unable to get
cleanly round the bend, collided with the opposite
shore, and even as they looked they saw the ice
mountains rear toward the sky, rise, collapse, and
rise again in glittering convulsions. The advancing
roar filled the air so that Walt could not make himself
heard; but he paused long enough to wave his
paddle significantly in the direction of Dawson.
Perhaps Charley Drake, seeing, might understand.</p>

<p>With two swift strokes they whirled the <i>Peterborough</i>
down-stream. They must keep ahead of
the rushing flood. It was impossible to make either
bank at that moment. Every ounce of their strength
went into the paddles, and the frail canoe fairly
rose and leaped ahead at every stroke. They said
nothing. Each knew and had faith in the other,
and they were too wise to waste their breath. The
shore-line—trees, islands and the Stewart River—flew
by at a bewildering rate, but they barely looked
at it.</p>

<p>Occasionally Chilkoot Jim stole a glance behind
him at the pursuing trail, and marked the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they held their own. Once he shaped a sharper
course toward the bank, but found the trail was
overtaking them, and gave it up.</p>

<p>Gradually they worked in to land, their failing
strength warning them that it was soon or never.
And at last, when they did draw up to the bank,
they were confronted by the inhospitable barrier of
the stranded shore-ice. Not a place could be found
to land, and with safety virtually within arm’s reach,
they were forced to flee on down the stream. They
passed a score of places, at each of which, had they
had plenty of time, they could have clambered out;
but behind pressed on the inexorable trail, and
would not let them pause.</p>

<p>Half a mile of this work drew heavily upon their
strength; and the trail came upon them nearer and
nearer. Its sullen grind was in their ears, and
its collisions against the bank made one continuous
succession of terrifying crashes. Walt felt his heart
thumping against his ribs and caught each breath
in painful gasps. But worst of all was the constant
demand upon his arms.</p>

<p>If he could only rest for the space of one stroke,
he felt that the torture would be relieved; but no,
it was dip and lift, dip and lift, till it seemed as if
at each stroke he would surely die. But he knew
that Chilkoot Jim was suffering likewise; that their
lives depended each upon the other; and that it
would be a blot upon his manhood should he fail
or even miss a stroke.</p>

<p>They were very weary, but their faith was large,
and if either felt afraid, it was not of the other, but
of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Flashing round a sharp point, they came upon
their last chance for escape. An island lay close inshore,
upon the nose of which the ice lay piled in a
long slope. They drove the <i>Peterborough</i> half out
of water upon a shelving cake and leaped out.
Then, dragging the canoe along, slipping and tripping
and falling, but always getting nearer the top,
they made their last mad scramble.</p>

<p>As they cleared the crest and fell within the
shelter of the pines, a tremendous crash announced
the arrival of the trail. One huge cake, shoved to
the top of the rim-ice, balanced threateningly above
them and then toppled forward.</p>

<p>With one jerk they flung themselves and the
canoe from beneath, and again fell, breathless and
panting for air. The thunder of the ice-run came
dimly to their ears; but they did not care. It held
no interest for them whatsoever. All they wished
was simply to lie there, just as they had fallen, and
enjoy the inaction of repose.</p>

<p>Two hours later, when the river once more ran
open, they carried the <i>Peterborough</i> down to the
water. But just before they launched it, Charley
Drake and a comrade paddled up in another canoe.</p>

<p>“Well, you boys hardly deserve to have good
folks out looking for you, the way you’ve behaved,”
was his greeting. “What under the sun made you
leave your tent and get chased by the trail? Eh?
That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>It took but a minute to explain the real state of
affairs, and but another to see Charley Drake hurrying
along on his way to his sick partner at Dawson.</p>

<p>“Pretty close shave, that,” Walt Masters said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as they prepared to get aboard and paddle back to
camp.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Chilkoot Jim replied, rubbing his
stiffened biceps in a meditative fashion.</p>

<h2 id="BIG_TIMBER_BEACON">BIG TIMBER BEACON</h2>

<p class="author">By John L. Mathews</p>

<p class="dropcap">There were three government beacon-lights
in Big Timber Bend, and the uppermost of
them was Barney Layton’s. It was nothing more
than a lantern set in a frame against a white target
on the top of a post, fifty feet from the edge of the
deep bank of the Mississippi River. It was at the
very head of the bend, at the foot of the “crossing”
by which the channel came from the lower end of
Silverplate Bend over into Big Timber. It stood
there so that the pilots on river steamers, coming
down, could set the bows of their boats toward it,
and run straight and true in the channel between
the lower end of McAlpin’s Bar and the head of
Nodaway Towhead.</p>

<p>When the river was low, this channel was both
shoal and narrow, and the white target by day and
the bright lantern by night had been gladly welcomed
by pilots who had figured their way over the
crossing in old days by sounding-pole and luck.</p>

<p>Every night at sunset Barney climbed the levee
in front of his mother’s cabin, walked the half-mile
down to the head of Big Timber, and out by a path
he had made through the big timber itself to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
light-post, carrying the lantern, which he set in
place and lighted. Every morning he came early
to put it out and carry it home for cleaning and
filling. For this the government paid his mother
seventy-five dollars a year, besides furnishing the
oil and other supplies; and seventy-five dollars a
year is a considerable amount behind a levee in
lower Arkansas.</p>

<p>The work was not always as easy as it sounds.
Some years the Mississippi never rises out of its
banks—and some years it does. When it did, it
filled all the big timber in front of the levee with
a rushing current, and Barney Layton had to use
main strength as well as his wits getting out in his
skiff to tend his light. Sometimes he would be carried
by, and washed a mile down-stream before he
could get out of the current and start home again;
and with the river out of its banks, he was always
rather glad when the post, too, was submerged, and
the support for his light was either nailed on a tree
in the front of the big timber or abandoned altogether
for a week or two.</p>

<p>Big Timber Bend had been stable for several
years. The swift current of the river sweeping by
its front had apparently taken not a foot of soil
from it. The light-post had been shifted hardly a
rod in two seasons. The crossing seemed to hold
its place.</p>

<p>But at last came a big water out of the Ohio,
which found the river already full and the lower
tributaries high. For weeks it stood over the banks
and against the levees, and when at last it went
down, it left the earthen banks saturated with water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
so that they could with difficulty sustain their own
weight without collapsing.</p>

<p>Then Silverplate Bend began to cave. As the
pressure of the water on its front was withdrawn,
the bank began to topple over and settle into the
river in great slices, eating back farther and farther,
changing the shape of the bend, and altering the
set of the current over the crossing. The deflected
swift water ate up into McAlpin’s Bar, and struck
Big Timber Bend a hundred yards above the light;
and one night the <i>Rupert Lee</i>, coming up, and
steering by Barney’s beacon, as it turned where the
crossing used to be, ran hard on a new bar at the
head of Nodaway Towhead. She got off before
morning, and lay up at the light till the crossing
could be sounded, and Barney had a chat about it
with pilot Ned Hinckley.</p>

<p>“Better get your light shifted,” said the pilot,
banteringly. “If we’d been coming down and
struck that bar with the current, the <i>Rupert</i> would
have left her bones in it. What good’s a false beacon,
youngster?”</p>

<p>“A false beacon?” Barney took that very much
to heart. He told his mother about it, and she forthwith
wrote to the lighthouse inspector; but the letter
was forestalled the next day, when the tender
<i>Lily</i> herself arrived with the inspector on board,
sounded out a new channel, and moved Barney’s
light up the bank to mark it.</p>

<p>“Now, Barney,” said the inspector, “you’ve got
to be on watch. That bank in Silverplate is going
to make trouble below. Big Timber Bend will begin
caving before many days. It can’t stand this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The water is seventy feet deep right in front of this
bank, and it must be cutting pretty steep now. The
snag boat will be along pretty soon and cut the
timber off quite away back, and then we’ll set the
light farther inland. But till then you must watch,
and if the bank where the light is starts to go, get
the target and nail it to the front of that big gum-tree
right behind it. If that goes, keep on working
straight back till we get here. The crossing is moving
up so you’ll be about right.”</p>

<p>Barney promised faithfully—and he kept his
word. He was only a boy of fifteen, and it was a
good deal of responsibility to have on his shoulders;
but Barney was used to all kinds of responsibility,
from taking care of his mother to hauling his cotton
to the gin. He would keep this beacon true.</p>

<p>The inspector’s prophecy was promptly verified.
Within a week Big Timber Bend was caving, and
caving badly. When Barney came to put the light
out one morning, he heard the roar of it—a roar
that made him run, for it was more than the noise
of earthen banks going in; it was the sound of trees
crashing into the river.</p>

<p>He hurried through the woods and found his
light still standing, but so close to the edge that it
seemed saved by a miracle. The bank before it had
given and slipped into the water, leaving not over
a foot of earth before the post, and the ladder by
which he usually mounted stuck out over empty air.</p>

<p>Barney approached cautiously, knowing that the
whole section on which he stood might at any moment
sink into the deep water. As he neared the
edge, there was a roar, and a big section ten rods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
down-stream went under. Barney felt chills run
up and down his spine, but he stayed to get his
light. Foot by foot he advanced, waiting to see if
anything would happen after each step, and reached
at last the six-foot post, “shinned” cautiously up
it, grasped the lantern, and retired to safer ground.</p>

<p>Then he thought of the target. To get it was a
task, for he might shake the post free and precipitate
himself into the eddying water thirty feet below.
But he must have the target. So cautiously
he went back, and cautiously he tugged and
wrenched until he had the white board loose. Then
he went back to the house for nails and a hammer;
and later in the day he came back to fix a new
mounting, and brought the lantern with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the river had not been idle. Barney
had left the white target at the foot of the big gum-tree
on which it was to be nailed; but the river had
evidently desired the piece of bank on which that
gum-tree stood, and had undermined it. It had
cracked off fifty feet back of the tree, and an acre
at more had slumped down about four feet. There
it had stopped, but Barney knew that the slightest
jar might be enough to start the whole piece settling
again beneath the river. Did he dare jump
down on it, run out, get his target, and scramble
back? Did he dare?</p>

<p>Barney thought about false beacons, and scarcely
hesitated. The bank on which he stood had cut
away as sharply as if chiseled, and the soil that
formed the edge was still wet and smooth. Over
it slipped Barney to the lower part, and hastened
toward the gum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He had just reached it when he felt a peculiar
trembling of the earth, and heard a series of loud
splashes at the waterside. A quick glance told him
what was happening. The whole loose segment on
which he stood had started slipping again. It went
slowly down, while Barney raced for the firm
bank; but when he reached the edge of the slipping
piece he was already confronted by a precipice at
least fifteen feet in height, to scale which was impossible.</p>

<p>Badly frightened, but not panic-stricken, he
made two or three futile attempts, only to bring
the earth crashing down with him; and realizing
that this was to invite immediate sinking of the
part he stood on, he looked for another plan. Up-
and down-stream ran the precipice which balked
him. All round the other sides the land gave sharply
down into the river, and at its feet washed that
swift current, which, within a short distance of the
edge, was seventy feet deep.</p>

<p>Barney went carefully back to the big gum-tree,
wondering how he would get off. As he stood by
it the earth slipped five or six feet lower, and Barney
realized that another six feet would put him
under water. Then he had an idea. There was one
route to possible safety—up the big gum-tree!</p>

<p>Sometimes when the bank goes in, such trees roll
over and drift away, their roots free of earth.
Sometimes they turn their roots up, embed their
branches in the bottom, and form dangerous snags.
But sometimes they stand upright for days, even
weeks, their tops out of water, their main trunk
and roots hidden deep beneath the flood. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
going down so straight that Barney hoped it might
take that course.</p>

<p>It was a big tree and the nearest fork was at
least twenty feet up. But Barney had brought his
hammer and a pocketful of four-inch nails for the
target. He picked the target up, and with two of
them nailed it firmly to the tree five feet above the
ground. He took a cord from his pocket and hung
his lantern over his shoulder, drove a spike two feet
from the ground for a step, mounted on it and
threw a knee over the target, and drove another
two feet above that.</p>

<p>Sitting on the target, he drove another still higher,
and then standing, drove another above that.
They were not directly in line, but formed a sort
of ladder for him, although a ladder difficult to
cling to.</p>

<p>He was still standing on the target when the
earth slipped again, and this time tilted, so that the
shore edge was below water-line; but the outer edge
was a foot or two above the eddies, and the tree
tilted shoreward slightly. That made climbing
easier. He was on the upper side, and could lean
somewhat against the tree. Nail after nail he
drove, and climbed steadily upward until, as he
reached the crotch and found branches on which
he could mount more easily, the land in which the
tree was rooted caved easily down into the turbulent
water!</p>

<p>Had a mad dog suddenly learned how to climb
a tree, and scrambled up after him, Barney could
not have climbed faster than he now went up the
rest of the big gum. He fairly jumped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
branch to branch, warned of the need of haste by
the gurgle of water below.</p>

<p>The bank went down steadily as he went up, but
at last it came to rest again, leaving Barney ten
feet above the water, and on the highest branch on
which he dared to risk his weight.</p>

<p>Looking about him, he discovered himself in a
dreadful plight. All round rushed the swift water
of the channel current, bending and swaying his
treetop till he feared it would be torn away. Fifty
feet of angry water lay between him and the shore,
and the shore itself was a frowning cliff almost perpendicular
and thirty feet high. It was three miles
down to the foot of Big Timber Bend, and Barney
could see no prospect of being able to swim out.</p>

<p>He cogitated until dusk came, and could not
imagine how any one would come to rescue him.</p>

<p>He had kept his hammer, thrust into his outside
pocket, when he sprang into the branches, and with
his last nail he made a hook for his lantern on the
swaying tree. Then he lighted and hung the
beacon.</p>

<p>“Must keep that true,” he said aloud, as he
did so.</p>

<p>Then settling himself in the most nearly comfortable
position he could find, he prepared to wait
until some solution of his difficulty was thrust upon
him, either by the final collapse of the tree or by the
arrival of rescue. As it was a warm summer night,
even the cool of the river could not make his position
impossible, and there was nothing for him to
do but wait.</p>

<p>When the big steamboat <i>Rupert Lee</i>, bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
down, swung into the head of Silverplate Bend
long after midnight, pilot Ned Hinckley prepared
for trouble.</p>

<p>“Landing’s gone,” he said to his helper on the
other side of the big wheel. “I saw Jim Higgins,
who came up in the <i>Walsh Honsell</i>, and he says it
has cut back a quarter of a mile. The whole bend
has gone. The two houses at the landing—the people
hardly got out. That’s what they get for living
outside the levee. I wish I knew what we’ll find in
the crossing below. Like as not, Big Timber Beacon
has gone into the river before now.”</p>

<p>The big side-wheeler coughed her way down
through the Silverplate Bend cautiously enough,
feeling it by the loom of the shore, since the lights
at the head and middle of it were gone.</p>

<p>Only a solitary beacon at the foot remained, and
as they swept the curve the pilot reached for a lever
and threw on the search-light, and with it lighted
up the bend.</p>

<p>All along its front, tree trunks cluttered a
ragged bank, and the water rustled through their
tops as they lay fallen half-over. He cut the
light off, and brought the steamboat a little
farther out.</p>

<p>“Hate to take chances on McAlpin’s Bar,” he
said. “But there are some nasty snags there, and
the bar is the lesser evil.”</p>

<p>So they came down to the foot of the bend and
to the solitary beacon. Then the pilot cast a glance
across the river.</p>

<p>“Well, by hokey!” he exclaimed. “Big Timber
Light is still standing. I’m glad of that. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<i>Lily</i> reset it, and if ever I was glad to see a light
I am glad to see that one now.”</p>

<p>He brought the big wheel spinning over toward
him, and the <i>Rupert Lee</i> swung its nose out from
the bank, and slowly turned its huge bulk till it
was headed toward the Big Timber Beacon. The
current swept it downward as it turned, so that
as it finally “straightened out,” the two lights bore
almost directly ahead and astern, the proper line
for a run through the thread of channel below McAlpin’s
Bar. Hinckley thoughtfully eyed the Big
Timber Beacon.</p>

<p>“Tommy,” he said, “does that light seem to be
as high up as usual?”</p>

<p>“Pretty low,” commented Tommy, peering out
into the darkness. “Looks to me like it ain’t steady,
either.”</p>

<p>The light was, indeed, swaying with the motion
of the tree, but a moment later it swayed much
more violently. Barney had taken it from its nail,
and was swinging it to and fro in a long arc, in the
usual manner of hailing a passing steamboat.</p>

<p>“It ain’t the beacon at all—or else some one is
using it for a signal-light!” exclaimed the pilot.</p>

<p>He threw the lever, and the search-light blazed
out. A turn of a little wheel overhead directed the
beams, and out of the darkness leaped the picture
of a caved bank, a treetop waving in the water, and
the figure of some one in the treetop swaying the
light.</p>

<p>“It’s the beacon all right,” said the pilot, “or it’s
where the beacon was.”</p>

<p>He reached for a rope, and sounded loudly three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
long blasts of the whistle, two short and another
long. On the lower deck all was activity at once.</p>

<p>“What’s the landing, Mr. Hinckley?” came a
deep voice from the darkness below. The pilot
leaned out of the window and answered:</p>

<p>“Head of Big Timber Bend, captain. Something
wrong with the beacon—some one in the
water.”</p>

<p>He signaled the engine-room and the wheels
stopped, and again the <i>Rupert Lee</i> swung round.</p>

<p>Hinckley took a quick survey of the bank up and
down the bend, then turned his light on the beacon
tree. The figure of Barney stood out in bold detail.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the pilot. “It’s the kid that tends
the light. Lower the stage on deck there, and brace
the inner end of it. Send some one out to pick the
boy out of that tree. We will have to do it quick.
Don’t miss him, now.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rupert Lee</i> was broadside to the current,
and drifting swiftly down-stream. The wheels
were barely turning.</p>

<p>The port landing-stage was run out forward and
lowered, a dozen negro hands were stationed on the
inboard end of it, and a stout “rouster” and the
mate ran to the outer end, where they hung out over
the water. Barney saw them coming and made
ready to be caught.</p>

<p>He hung the lantern on its nail, freed himself
from the branches, and as Hinckley, with the skill
of a lifelong experience, set the wheels of the
steamer back to clear the nest of fallen trees, Barney
reached out, and the two on the landing-stage
caught him and dragged him on board. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
steamer backed away and turned down-stream, and
Barney, after hearty congratulations from the
lower deck, was escorted to the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“Hello, bub!” said the pilot, as he came in. “No
false light about you, is there? You guided us over
that crossing straight as a die, and I’ll report the
way you did it to the department.”</p>

<p>He did report him, too, and things came of that;
but the ending of this story came when Barney had
been put aboard the <i>Kate Clancy</i> in the bend below,
to be carried back home. And as the <i>Kate
Clancy</i> came up through Big Timber Bend, to drop
him at the foot of McAlpin’s Bar, he and her captain
surveyed the scene of his adventure, and found
no sign of the beacon, for the big gum-tree and the
lantern had gone into the river.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_HILDA_GOT_A_SCHOOL">HOW HILDA GOT A SCHOOL</h2>

<p class="author">By Lelia Munsell</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Well, Hilda, do you want to try again?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kenyon had hung up his overcoat
and cap and was standing with his back to the fire,
which Hilda had quickened when she heard him
coming. She knew he would be chilled, for it was
a cold February night.</p>

<p>“Johnston told me that there would be a change
for the spring term down here in Hazel Row,” he
went on. “The board is going to meet next Monday,
he said. So if you want to try again we’d
better get in your application within a day or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon heard her husband’s question, and
came in from the kitchen to hear what further he
might have to say, while the two younger children
dropped their play to listen. They were all interested
in Hilda’s attempt to get a school.</p>

<p>“You could board at home if you got that,” said
Mrs. Kenyon. “It’s only two miles.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kenyon laughed. “Better catch your hare
before you cook it. Perhaps Hilda doesn’t even
want to try again.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” cried Hilda, indignantly, “you know I
want to try again! But now listen, you and
mamma both. And please don’t think I don’t appreciate
what you have done to help me; but I
want to go all alone this time. If I am ever going
to make a teacher, I must learn to depend upon
myself. I can’t always have you to do things for
me. And besides, I don’t blame a school board
for not hiring a teacher who hasn’t grit enough
to apply alone. You know I can’t say anything
for myself when you are along, papa. I can talk
before a stranger lots better than I can before
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should feel that way,” interposed
Mrs. Kenyon. “You surely are not
afraid of your father.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of him in one sense, but in another
sense I am. I can’t talk to the directors before
him as I could if I were alone. I let papa apply
for me last fall, and I let him go along twice this
spring, and I haven’t a school yet.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon started to speak, but her husband
shook his head at her. “I guess we’ll have to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
you have your way this time,” he said. “We’ll see
if you succeed any better than I did.”</p>

<p>Hilda gave him a grateful look.</p>

<p>“But how are you going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I walk? It isn’t far.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. Johnston, of course, is less than
two miles away, but Mr. Andrews lives four or five
miles northeast, and Smith is as far in the other
direction. You’ll have twelve or fourteen miles to
travel by the time you get back home. There is
too much snow for you to walk, anyway, even if it
wasn’t too far. And I can’t trust you to drive the
team alone as cold as it is.”</p>

<p>“I can ride old Selim. He’s safe enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s safe enough. But you will find it
pretty cold, riding so far on horseback.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let your father take you in the
buggy,” said Mrs. Kenyon. “You’ll freeze to death
on Selim.”</p>

<p>“Now, mamma, please!” begged Hilda, and her
mother said no more.</p>

<p>Hilda had many ambitions, but the nearest and
most absorbing one was to get a school. Beyond
that lay a college course, and beyond that—she
hardly dare to think of all the good things the
future might hold for her and hers if only she might
go to college.</p>

<p>But she knew that the money for a college course
must come from her own efforts.</p>

<p>She had been a very proud girl when her first
certificate came. It was only for a year, of course.
According to the laws of the state, one must have
taught three months to receive a certificate for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
longer time than that. But her grades were high
enough to entitle her to a second class.</p>

<p>The county superintendent had enclosed a kind
little note with the certificate, and had spoken personally
to her father, commending her work very
highly. Hilda felt that she had a right to be
proud.</p>

<p>But the certificate in itself was not worth much.
Its chief value lay in the fact that it entitled her to
teach if she could get a school. And how she did
want a school! She dreamed of it by night and
talked of it by day.</p>

<p>Her father’s announcement that there was a
vacancy so near home raised her hopes again. If
she could get the place she could save all her salary,
for the schoolhouse was so near that she could board
at home, as her mother had said. She must get it,
that was all. And she felt that she must go alone.
Mr. Kenyon made no objection this time, and Mrs.
Kenyon consented on the condition that Hilda
would allow herself to be well bundled up for the
long, cold ride.</p>

<p>Hilda readily consented to this, but she almost
rued her bargain in the morning when her mother
insisted on putting a large coat of her own over
Hilda’s and in tying a scarf over the warm hood,
and when the girl had climbed on the horse she had
wrapped a warm shawl about her.</p>

<p>“How in the world am I to get on and off again
with all this stuff, mamma?” she asked. “I feel as
wrapped up as a mummy. I know I’ll frighten all
the horses I meet.”</p>

<p>It was well, perhaps, that she could not see herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for she certainly cut rather a ridiculous figure.
Added to all the rest, she was riding her father’s
saddle. The right stirrup had been thrown over,
and in this her foot rested, while the left stirrup
dangled below. She had never been fortunate
enough to possess a side-saddle, and had often ridden
in this way about the farm.</p>

<p>But she could not help feeling a little sensitive
about her appearance on this occasion, which
meant so much to her, and she wished her mother
would not be so fussy.</p>

<p>As she drew near Mr. Johnston’s house, she considered.</p>

<p>It would take her some time to disentangle herself
from her many wrappings, and to any one
watching from the house she would present rather
a ridiculous appearance in her necessarily clumsy
efforts to dismount.</p>

<p>So she halted old Selim some distance from
the front gate, and here, hidden by the trees, she
divested herself of her extra garments.</p>

<p>Her heart was pounding away vigorously as she
knocked and inquired if Mr. Johnston was in. She
had known him ever since she could remember,
but he seemed suddenly to have become almost a
stranger. Outwardly, however, it was a very dignified
young lady who presented her case before
him.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that he looked at her for fully
five minutes without speaking.</p>

<p>“So you want to teach?” he asked at last.
“Pretty young, aren’t you? How old are you?
Seventeen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Hilda. “I suppose that
isn’t very old, but I have a good certificate, and I
am pretty sure that I can teach a good school. At
least, I’d try my best if you would give me a
chance.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” remarked Mr.
Johnston.</p>

<p>“I know. But that is all I <em>can</em> say till somebody
gives me a chance to show what I can do.”</p>

<p>“You have had no experience, of course.”</p>

<p>“No. But if I am ever to make a teacher, I’ll
have to teach my first school sometime and somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so. Got some pretty good grades
here.” He had been examining the certificate she
had handed him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Hilda, modestly.</p>

<p>Again he was silent. Then he handed her back
her certificate. “Well, I’ll tell you, Hilda. So
far as I am concerned, I am willing to give you a
chance. I’ve known you ever since you were a
baby, and I know you are a wide-awake, energetic
little girl. But I’m only one of three, and I am
afraid you won’t stand the best of chances with the
other two. You don’t know either of them personally,
do you? I thought not. Andrews wants
the place for a cousin of his, and Smith will think
you are too young. But go and see both of them.
Don’t tell them what I’ve said. Simply say that
you spoke to me about it. Smith is president of the
board.”</p>

<p>Hilda thanked him and went her way, much encouraged
in spite of what he had said about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
possible reception by the other two members.
She experienced some difficulty in mounting and
dismounting each time, encumbered as she was, but
that did not trouble her much now, although she
was careful at both places to stop far enough away
from the house, as she had done at Mr. Johnston’s,
to enable her to accomplish this feat without being
seen.</p>

<p>And she was truly thankful that no one asked
her how she came. She much preferred that the
men whose interest she was trying to enlist should
not see her perched up on old Selim, like a big
round bump on a log, as her father had expressed
it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she found both Mr. Andrews and
Mr. Smith at home, but she did not receive the encouragement
from them that she had done from
Mr. Johnston.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Andrews told her that the school
was as good as engaged, and that it was useless
for her to see Mr. Smith. Hilda, remembering
what Mr. Johnston had told her about the
cousin, made no reply, but resolved to call upon
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith listened to her courteously and
quietly. “Pretty young, aren’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Hilda laughed. “I expected you to say that.
But it isn’t always age and experience that make
success. I have always wanted to teach, and I’ve
always thought I could teach, and I believe I can,
if I <em>am</em> young.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but that’s the right way to talk.
We’ve got to believe in ourselves before we ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
amount to much. How much would you want a
month?”</p>

<p>She was not prepared for this question. In her
heart she knew that she would take the school at
whatever they might offer. But she reflected that
it would not be policy to say so, so she answered:</p>

<p>“Whatever you have been paying for your
spring term.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll talk over your application Monday.
If we want you, we will let you know. You needn’t
come to see us about it again.”</p>

<p>Hilda was obliged to be content with this. She
thanked him, and then, behind the grove where she
had tied her horse, she bundled herself up for the
ride home, where an eager audience listened to her
story while she thawed out her fingers and toes.</p>

<p>The next six days seemed interminably long to
her, but Monday came at last. All day she listened
expectantly for a step on the front porch, but no
one came that day or the next. Wednesday morning
she was helping her father about the barn, when
she heard some one behind her, and turned to face
Mr. Johnston.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried. “So you concluded to try
farming if you couldn’t get a school?”</p>

<p>Hilda smiled in reply. She could not trust herself
to speak. So she had failed again.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnston chatted with her father for a time,
while she went bravely on with her work. It would
never do to let him know how disappointed she was.</p>

<p>“Well, Hilda,” he said, finally, “I’ll expect you
to do me credit this spring.”</p>

<p>Hilda looked up, surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“We concluded we would try you,” he continued.
“Andrews stuck out for his cousin, but Smith went
with me. Smith was quite taken with you. Andrews’
cousin had let him attend to her application,
and had never come to see one of us about it.
Smith didn’t like that way of doing things, and I
confess I don’t, myself. You’ll get thirty-five dollars
for three months. If that is satisfactory, I
guess we might as well go to the house and sign the
contract now.”</p>

<p>Hilda felt that she was treading on air as she
followed him to the house, and when she saw her
name signed to the little slip of paper, the contract
between herself and District No. 33, she secretly
pinched herself to see if she were awake. She
wanted to shout, but of course that would not do.
But the moment Mr. Johnston was gone she seized
her mother about the waist and whirled her round
the room.</p>

<p>“Just think, mamma! Just think!” she cried.
“I’ve actually got a school. One hundred and five
dollars, and no board to pay. Maybe, now, I won’t
have to wait any longer to go to college than I had
expected to do in the first place. And, mamma,”
she drew her mother close and whispered in her ear,
“when I get to be a professor in some big university
you won’t have to work any more, and I can
give you the things that I’ve wanted and wanted
so long to give you.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_IMP_AND_THE_DRUM">THE IMP AND THE DRUM</h2>

<p class="author">By Josephine Dodge Daskam Bacon</p>

<p class="dropcap">It never would have happened but for Miss
Eleanor’s mission class. Once a week through
the winter she went in the cars to a town not
far from the city, where there were a great many
mills, but few schools, and talked to a crowd of
the mill-hands’ little children. She did not give
them lessons, exactly, but she told them stories
and sang songs with them and interested them in
keeping themselves and their homes clean and
pretty. They were very fond of her and were
continually bringing in other children, so that after
the first year she gave up the small room she had
rented and took them up two flights into an old
dancing-hall, a little out of the center of the town.</p>

<p>The Imp had been from the beginning deeply
interested in this scheme, and when he learned
that many of the boys were just exactly eight and
a half—his own age—and that they played all
sorts of games and told stories and sang songs,
and had good times generally, his interest and
excitement grew, and every Thursday found him
begging his mother or big aunty, with whom they
spent the winter, to telephone to his dear Miss
Eleanor that this time he was to accompany her
and see all those fascinating children: big Hans,
who, though fourteen, was young for his years
and stupid; little Olga, who was only eleven, but
who mothered all the others, and had brought
more children into the class than anyone else;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Pierre, who sang like a bird, and wore a dark-blue
jersey and a knitted cap pulled over his ears; red-headed
Mike, who was all freckles and fun; and
pretty, shy Elizabeth, with deep violet eyes and
a big dimple, who was too frightened to speak at
first, and who ran behind the door even now if a
stranger came.</p>

<p>But it was not till the Imp gave up being eight
and a half and arrived at what his Uncle Stanley
called quarter of nine that Miss Eleanor decided
that he might go if his mother would let him.</p>

<p>“I used to think,” she said, “that it wouldn’t
be wise to take him. I thought they’d feel
awkward; for of course he’s better dressed, and
I don’t want them to feel that they’re being shown
off or made an exhibition of, even to a child. But
I know them so well now, and I’ve told them about
him and how he loves to play games, and wants to
come, and I think it may really be a good thing—for
both sides.”</p>

<p>So on one delicious Thursday in early February,
the Imp boarded the train proudly, and they
steamed out of the big station. He had gone over
the entire afternoon, in anticipation, with Harvey,
his little lame friend, who could not go to school,
but did his lessons with a tutor, and with whom
the Imp studied every morning during the three
or four months they spent in the city; and Harvey
was as interested as he, and sent his best love to
them all.</p>

<p>From the moment of the Imp’s entrance, when
his cheerful “Hullo!” made him any number of
friends, and his delight at being there made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
all delighted to have him, he was a great success;
and when big Hans, with a furtive glance at the
Imp’s clean hands, went quietly off to the ever-ready
basin and washed his own, Miss Eleanor
regretted that she had not brought him sooner.</p>

<p>When they had finished the story about Washington
at Valley Forge—for Miss Eleanor was
quietly teaching them history—she got them into
a long line that reached quite around the room, and
went out for a moment, returning with a drum
in her hand: not a play drum, but a real one, with
polished black sticks and a fascinating strap to cross
over the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she, “we’re going to learn the fire-drill,
and we’ll take turns at the drum.”</p>

<p>The children were delighted, and stood still as
mice while she explained the order of affairs. In
the big city public schools, she had been told, they
practiced going out in line at a mock alarm of fire,
and the boy or girl who broke out of line or dashed
for the door before the drum-tap was disgraced for
days in the eyes of the school. Everything must
be quiet and in order; every child must have his
place and take it; no one must cry out, or run
ahead, or push, or try to hurry matters; and what
was most important, all must keep step—which was
why the drum came to be there.</p>

<p>She arranged them carefully: little one first,
then girls, last of all the boys, with big Hans at
the rear, and Olga managing a crowd of the little
ones.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “we won’t leave the room this
first time; we’ll just march round and round till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
can all keep step, and later we’ll practice going
through the halls and downstairs. I’ll drum the
first time, and then the best boy shall be drummer.”</p>

<p>The friend who had suggested the fire-drill
when Miss Eleanor had begged her for some new
game to play, had never seen one, and did not know
the exact details, but she knew the general idea of
it, and she knew, too, that it was not at all easy
for people to keep in step, even to a drum. This
had surprised Miss Eleanor greatly. She supposed
that anybody could keep step, and she was much
inclined to doubt her friend’s statement that a large
number of grown people, even, found it difficult.</p>

<p>But there was a still greater surprise in store
for her. When she slung the strap over her pretty
red waist and hit the drum a resounding blow, a
very different sound from what she had expected
was the result—a muffled, flat noise, with nothing
inspiring about it whatever. She bit her lip and
tried again, the children watching her attentively
from the sides of the big room.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

<p>A few feet began to keep time, but the sound
was not very different from that produced by a
stick hit against the wall, and big Hans, whose
father played in a band, and who had attended
many rehearsals—it was from him the drum had
been procured—shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>“Not so! Not so!” he said in his thick, gruff
voice. “You no hit good! You no hit hard!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hans, can <em>you</em> play it?” cried Miss Eleanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
eagerly. “Here, take it!” And she flung the
strap over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Hans shambled out to the center of the room,
and struck a mighty blow. The familiar deep
sound of a drum filled the place, and Miss Eleanor
sighed with relief, but alas! her joy was short-lived,
for poor Hans had no idea of time, and could
only pound away like a hammer. In vain she held
his hand and tried to guide his strokes. The noise
was deafening, but no more to be marched to than
thunder.</p>

<p>Little Pierre tried next, but though he kept
perfect time, and looked very cunning in his little
blue blouse, his taps were too light to cover the
sound of the tramping feet.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor’s cheeks were red with vexation.
Her arm ached, and the children were getting restless.
She did not know what to do.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! <em>Who</em> would have thought it was
so hard?” she exclaimed pathetically. And then
she noticed the Imp, who was fairly holding his
lips in his effort to keep silence. For he had
solemnly promised his mother not to put himself
forward, nor suggest anything, nor offer to do a
single thing till he was asked, on pain of never
coming again.</p>

<p>“What is it, Perry?” she asked.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can—<em>I</em> can play a drum, Miss Eleanor!” he
burst out.</p>

<p>She looked doubtful: the Imp was given to
thinking that he could do most things.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a play drum, you know, dear; it’s
a real one,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I can play a real one. Truly I can! Mr.
Archer taught me—he was a truly drummer-boy
in the war; he showed me how. He said I could
hit it up like a good ’un!” the Imp exploded again.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor dimly remembered that among
the Imp’s amazing list of acquaintances, a one-legged
Grand Army man, who kept a newspaper-stall,
had been mentioned, and decided that it could
do no harm to let him try.</p>

<p>“Well, put it on,” she said, and the Imp proudly
assumed the drum, grasped the sticks loosely between
his fingers, wagged his head knowingly
from side to side, and began.</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm! brrrm! brrrm!</p>

<p>The straggling line straightened, the children
began to grin, and little Pierre, at the head of the
line, stamped his foot and started off. Miss
Eleanor’s forehead smoothed, and she smiled encouragingly
at the Imp.</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it!” she cried delightedly.
“How easy it looks!”</p>

<p>But the Imp stopped suddenly, and the moving
line stopped with him.</p>

<p>“Wait! I forgot!” he said peremptorily. “You
mustn’t start till I do this.”</p>

<p>And with a few preliminary taps he gave the
long roll that sends a pleasant little thrill to the
listener’s heart.</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrrr—<em>um</em> dum!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The children jumped with delight, and the line
started off, the Imp drumming for dear life around
the inside of the big square, and Miss Eleanor
keeping the hasty ones back and hurrying the
stragglers, trying to make big Hans feel the
rhythm, and suppressing Pierre’s happy little
skips.</p>

<p>After a half-hour of this they begged to try the
halls and stairs, and the Imp stood proudly on the
landings, keeping always at about the middle of
the line, stamping his right foot in time with his
sticks, his eyes shining with joy, his little body
straight as a dart.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor was delighted. The boys responded
so well to her little talk on protecting
the girls and waiting till they were placed before
taking their own stand in the line, the girls stood
so straight, the little ones entered so well into
the spirit of the thing, that she felt that afternoon
to have been one of the best they had had, and
confided as much to the Imp on their journey
home.</p>

<p>As for the Imp, he had a new interest in life,
and talked of little else than the fire-drill for days.
There was no question as to his going the next
Thursday, and he and his drum formed the chief
attraction of the day, for the drill proved the most
popular game of all, and after the proclamation
had gone forth that none but clean-handed, neatly
dressed, respectful boys need aspire to head the
line, such boys were in a great and satisfying
majority.</p>

<p>For a month they had been practicing regularly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and by the end of that time every child knew his
place and took it instantly at the opening tap.
It was pretty to see little Olga shake back her
yellow pigtails and marshal her tiny brood into
line; even the smallest of them kept step nicely
now.</p>

<p>Only big Hans could not learn, and Pierre
walked by his side in vain, trying to make him
feel the rhythm of the Imp’s faithful drumsticks.</p>

<p>There was one feature of the drill that amused
Miss Eleanor’s friends greatly. Of course there
was no fire-alarm in the old hall, and she would
not let anyone cry out or even pretend for a
moment that there was any real danger. She
merely called sharply, “<em>Now!</em>” when they were
to form, and it was one of the suppressed excitements
of the afternoon to wait for that word.
They never knew when it would come.</p>

<p>For Miss Eleanor’s one terror was fire. Twice,
as a little girl, she had been carried out of a
burning house; and the flames bright against the
night, the hoarse shouts of the firemen, the shock
of the frightened awakening, and the chill of the
cold winter air had so shaken her nerves that she
could hardly bear to remember it. Burglars had
little terror for her; in accidents she was cool and
collected; more than once, in a quiet way, she had
saved people from drowning; but a bit of flaming
paper turned her cheeks white and made her hands
tremble. So though big Hans begged to be allowed
to call out “Fire!” she would never let him, and
though she explained the meaning of the drill to
them, it is to be doubted if they attached much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
importance to the explanation, as she herself did
not care to talk about it long.</p>

<p>One fine, windy Thursday—it was the second
Thursday in March, and the last Thursday the
Imp would be able to spend with his new friends,
for he was going back to the country—they started
out a little depressed in spirits: the Imp because
it was his last visit, Miss Eleanor because she
was afraid her children were in danger of a hard
week. The hands of three of the largest factories
were “on strike,” and though they were quite in
the wrong, and were demanding more than any
but the ring-leaders themselves felt to be just, they
were excited to the pitch of rage that no reasoning
can calm, and as the superintendents had absolutely
refused to yield any further, affairs were at
a deadlock.</p>

<p>One or two of Miss Eleanor’s friends had grown
alarmed, and urged her not to go there till the
matter was settled, but she would not hear of
this.</p>

<p>“Why, this is the very time I want to keep the
children out of the streets!” she said. “They all
know me—nobody would hurt me. They know I
love the children, and I have nothing to do with
their quarrel. I should be willing to trust myself
to any of them. They have always been very polite
and respectful to me, and they’ve been getting
ready for this for two weeks, for that matter.”</p>

<p>Her father agreed to this, and assured the
Imp’s mother that any demonstration that might
take place would be at the other end of the town,
near the mills, and that it was very unlikely that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
anything further than a shut-down for a few days
would result, at most.</p>

<p>“They’re in the wrong, and most of them know
it, I hear,” he said. “They can’t hold out long:
nobody else will hire them.”</p>

<p>This may have been true, but it did not add to
their good-humor. As the Imp and Miss Eleanor
walked up through the village, the streets were
filling rapidly with surly, idle men. Dark-eyed
Italians, yellow-haired Swedes, shambling, gesticulating
Irish, and dogged, angry English jostled
each other on the narrow walks, and talked loudly.
Miss Eleanor hurried the Imp along, picking up
a child here and there on the way, and sighing with
relief as she neared the old hall.</p>

<p>Some of the excitement had reached the children,
and though they had come in large numbers, for
they knew it was the Imp’s last visit for some time,
and there had been hints of a delightful surprise
for them on this occasion, they were restless and
looked out of the windows often. There was a
shout of applause when, the Imp suddenly becoming
overwhelmed with shyness, Miss Eleanor
invited them all out to his home for one day in the
summer; but the excitement died down, and more
than one of the older children glanced slyly at the
door. The men from that end of the town were
filing by, and most of the women were following
after.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor racked her brains for some amusement.</p>

<p>It was cold in the room, for the boy who had
charge of the clumsy old-fashioned stove was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sick that day, and there was no fire. So partly to
keep them contented, and partly to get them warm,
she proposed a game of blindman’s-buff. There
was a shout of assent, and presently they were in
the midst of a tremendous game. The stamping
feet of the boys and the shrill cries of the girls made
a deafening noise; the dust rose in clouds; the
empty old building echoed confusingly. The fun
grew fast and furious; the rules were forgotten;
the boys began to scuffle and fight, and the little
girls danced about excitedly.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor called once or twice to quiet them,
but they were beyond control; they paid no attention
to her.</p>

<p>With a little grimace she stepped out of the
crowd to breathe, and took out her watch.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes!” she said to little Olga, who
followed her about like a puppy. “I’ll give them
ten more, and then they <em>must</em> stop!”</p>

<p>Little Olga began to cough, and looked doubtfully
at the old stove, which was given to smoking.</p>

<p>“It smells bad just the same, don’t it?” she
called. They had to raise their voices to be heard
above the noise.</p>

<p>“No, child, it’s the dust. Isn’t it dreadful?”
Miss Eleanor called back, coughing herself. “But
it smells just like smoke. How horrid it is! And
how hot!” she added after a moment. “With the
windows open, too! We’ll all take cold when we
go out. They <em>must</em> stop! Boys, boys! Hans,
come here to me!”</p>

<p>She rang a little bell that was the signal for
quiet, and raised her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I’m going to open the door, to get a
thorough draft, and then we’ll quiet down,” she
said, and pushed through the crowd to the door.</p>

<p>As she opened it wide, a great cloud of brown,
hot smoke poured into the room, a loud roaring,
with little snapping crackles behind it, came from
below, and Miss Eleanor suddenly put her hand to
her heart, turned perfectly white, and half fell, half
leaned against the door.</p>

<p>For a moment the children were quite still, so
still that through the open door they could hear the
roar and the crackle. Then suddenly, before she
could prevent him, little Pierre slipped through and
started down the hall. With a cry she went after
him, half the children following her, but in a moment
they crowded back, screaming and choking.
The stairs at the end of the long hall were half on
fire!</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor tried to call out, but though her
lips moved, she could not speak above a whisper.
She shut the door and leaned against it, and the
look in her eyes frightened the children out of what
little control they had.</p>

<p>“Call,” she said hoarsely, “call ‘Fire!’ out of the
window. Quick! Call, all of you!”</p>

<p>But they stumbled about, crying and gasping,
some of them struggling to get by her out of the
door. She was trembling violently, but she pushed
them away and held the door-knob as tightly as she
could.</p>

<p>Only Olga ran to the open window, and sent
a piercing little shriek out into the quiet street:</p>

<p>“<em>Fire! Fire! Come along! Fire!</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment there was no answer, and then a
frightened woman ran out of her house and waved
her hand.</p>

<p>“Come out! Come out, you!” she called.</p>

<p>“Our stairs is burnt all up! We can’t!” screamed
Olga.</p>

<p>The woman ran quickly down the empty
street, calling for help as she ran, and the children
surged about the door, a crowd of frightened
little animals, trying to drag Miss Eleanor away
from it.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she begged them, “wait! You can’t
go that way—they’ll bring ladders! Oh, <em>please</em>
wait!”</p>

<p>Her knees shook beneath her, the room swam
before her eyes. The smell of the smoke, stronger
and stronger, sickened her. With a thrill of terror,
she saw big Hans drag a child away from the
window, and deliberately pushing her down, prepare
to climb out over her, almost stepping on her
little body.</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught sight of the Imp. He was
pushing his way through the crowd valiantly, but
not toward her.</p>

<p>“Come here, Perry!” she said weakly. But he
paid no attention. He had been dazed for a moment,
and like all the other children, her terror had
terrified him quite as much as the fire. Now as he
caught her eye, and saw the helpless fear in her
face as she watched Hans, something sent him
away from her to a farther corner, and as the smoke
began to come up between the boards of the floor,
and the same deadly stillness reigned outside, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the confusion grew greater in the hot, crowded
room, a new sound cut through the roar and the
crackle.</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm, brrrm, brrrm!</p>

<p>The children turned. Big Hans, with one leg
out of the window, looked back. There was a little
rush, half checked, for the sides of the room, and
Olga instinctively looked about for her small
charges.</p>

<p>But they wavered undecidedly, and as the sound
of steps outside and the clattering of horses’ feet
reached them, a new rush for the door began, and
Miss Eleanor’s hand slipped from the knob, and
she half fell beside it.</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm—<em>um</em> dum!</p>

<p>That familiar long roll had never been disobeyed;
the habit of sudden, delighted response was strong;
and with a quick recollection that he was to be head
boy, big Hans slipped from the window-sill and
jumped to the head of a straggling line. Olga was
behind him in a moment, and Pierre, proud of his
position as rear-guard and time-keeper for the
little boys, pushed them, crying and coughing, into
place.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor must have been half unconscious
for a moment. When she struggled to her feet,
no scrambling crowd, but an orderly, tramping
line pushed by her, and above the growing tumult
outside, above the sickening roar of the fire below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
came the quick, regular beat of the faithful
drum.</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm!</p>

<p>Brrrm, brrrm, brrrm!</p>

<p>The children marched as if hypnotized. The
long line just filled the sides of the room, and they
were squeezed in so tightly that they forced each
other on unconsciously. The Imp in his excitement
beat faster than usual, and his bright red cheeks,
his straight little figure, as he walked his inside
square, his quick, nervous strokes, were an inspiration
to the most scared laggard. Big Hans, elated
at his position—his for the first time—never took
his eyes off the black sticks, and worked his mouth
excitedly, keeping time to the beats, the Imp frowning
at his slightest misstep.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor, the door hot against her back,
forced her trembling lips into a smile, and cheered
them on as they tramped round and round. Was
nothing being done? Would no one come?</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a thundering, a clanging,
and a quick, sharp ringing gong came closer with
every stroke; the sound of many running feet, too,
and loud, hoarse orders. The line wavered, seemed
to stop. She summoned all her strength, and called
out aloud for the first time:</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, children! Keep right on! Stand
straight, Hans, and show them how well you can
lead!”</p>

<p>Hans tossed his head, glared at a boy across
the room who had broken through, and forged
ahead. There was a succession of quick blows on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the sides of the room, a rush, and in another moment
three helmeted heads looked through three
windows. At the same moment a sharp hissing
sound interrupted the roaring below, and though
the door was brown behind her now, and a tiny
red point was glowing brighter in the wall near by,
Miss Eleanor’s strength returned at the sight of
the firemen, and she stood by the side of the Imp
and encouraged the children.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, Hans! Remember, little ones first!
Olga’s children first!”</p>

<p>And with a grunt of assent Hans marched on,
the line following, closing up mechanically over
the gaps the men made, who snatched out the
children as they passed by the windows, and handed
them rapidly down the long ladders. In vain the
firemen tried to get the boys. They wriggled obstinately
out of their grasp, as they went round,
till every girl was lifted out, Olga standing by the
window till the last of her charges was safe.</p>

<p>The door fell in with a bang, and in spite of
the hose below, the smoke rolled up from between
the cracks in the floor, thicker and thicker. As
the plaster dropped from the walls in great blocks,
Miss Eleanor dragged the line into the center of
the room, and motioned one of the men to take the
Imp as he passed by. For so perfect was the order
that the men never once needed to step into the
room, only leaning over the sills to lift out the
children. The Imp felt a strong grasp on his arm,
and pulled away; the man insisted.</p>

<p>“Hurry now, hurry, let go!” he commanded
gruffly. The despair in the Imp’s eyes as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
drummed hard with his other hand grew to rage,
and he brought down his free stick with a whack
on the man’s knuckles. With a sharp exclamation
the man let go, and the Imp pressed on, his
cheeks flaming, his eyes glowing. His head was
high in the air, he was panting with excitement.
The line was small now; another round and there
would be but a handful. The floor near the door
began to sag, and the men took two at a time of
the bigger boys, and left them to scramble down
by themselves. With every new child a shout
went up from below. As Hans slipped out by
himself, and two men lifted Miss Eleanor out
of one window, a third meanwhile carrying the
Imp, kicking in his excitement, and actually beating
the drum as it dangled before him, while a
fourth man took a last look, and crying “O. K.!
All out!” ran down his ladder alone, the big crowd
literally shouted with thankfulness and excitement.</p>

<p>As for the Imp, he felt tired and shaky, now
that somebody had taken away his drum, and all
the women were trying to kiss him; and he watched
the blackened walls crash in without a word. His
knees felt hollow and queer, and there was nobody
to take him in her lap like the other children, for
Miss Eleanor had quietly fainted in the firemen’s
arms, and they were sprinkling her with water from
the little pools where the big hose had leaked.</p>

<p>They took them to the station in a carriage,
and the Imp sat in Miss Eleanor’s lap in a drawing-room
car, and she cuddled him silently all the
way home. Her father, dreading lest she should
be hurt somehow after all in the crowded streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
passed them in an express going in the other
direction, to find out that they were safe, and that
the strike was off. The recent danger had sobered
the men, and their thankfulness at their children’s
safety had softened them, so that their ring-leaders’
taunts had no effect on their determination to go
back to work quietly the next day.</p>

<p>It was at her father’s request that they refrained
from any more costly gift to Miss Eleanor than
a big photographic group of the children, framed
in plush, “as an expression of their deep gratitude
for her presence of mind in keeping the children in
the room away from the deadly flames beneath.”
But to the Imp the Mill Town drum corps and

<h2 id="THE_SECOND_STRING">THE SECOND STRING</h2>

<p class="author">By James B. Connolly</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Interscholastic Athletic Association was
holding its annual track meeting. In the
athletic building a hundred lads or more were dressing
or rubbing in preparation for the different
events. The clerk of the course, sticking his head
within the door, shouted, “Last call for the hundred
yards final! Last call! Hurry now, fellows!”</p>

<p>The graduate coach of Webster High School cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
short his instructions to a medium-sized, heedful,
earnest-looking lad. “There now, I’ll have to go
and see how Prouty runs in the hundred. But bear
in mind, Haskins, what you’re to do when your race
comes. Keswick is out to run the field off its feet.
And if they follow him he’ll do it. You are to get
the inside track—on the first run get the pole, mind,
if you have to do forty yards in record time to do
it. That will start a break in Keswick’s plans. Then
you make the pace—with an eye all the way to
Stevenson. Perhaps you’ll carry Sullivan off his
feet, too, at the same time. That’s not likely,
though. Anyway, carry Stevenson along—clear
round to the home-stretch, and make it so hot for
Keswick on the way that he’ll be done up at that
point. Land Stevenson in the straight in good
shape and your work will be done. Drop out then
if you want to, and I guess you’ll want to drop.
You’ve an hour yet. When Stevenson comes from
the rubbing board, jolly him along a bit. He’s apt
to get—nervous—you know. Got it all?”</p>

<p>“I think so.” Haskins lay back on his mat for
rest and meditation.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Stevenson, a tall, rangy lad, came
over from the other side of the room. He halted
above Haskins, and looked about, as if seeking a
place to lie.</p>

<p>Haskins caught his glance. “They’re all in
use, I guess, Stevie. Take this place. You’ll want
all the rest you can get for your race.”</p>

<p>“You’re not done? You’ve got to run, too.”</p>

<p>“O shucks—me—second string—I’m only to
make pace for you. Mr. Ludwig just told me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, all right—thanks. Think you can do it
right?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’ll be hard getting the pole
from Keswick. He’s in for the same game—making
way for Sullivan. We’ll have a great time of
it, Keswick and I. I wonder which will flop first?
But I’ll make for that pole—though Keswick’s a
hound for a quick start—and try to hold on for the
straight again. That’ll do, won’t it? If I kill off
Keswick so he won’t be of any use, you can give all
your attention to Sullivan? He’s a good man,
Sullivan, but you can give him yards and a licking
any day in the week, Stevie.”</p>

<p>“Think so, Dickie?”</p>

<p>“Think? I know it. He hasn’t your stride,
your speed, or your head, and you’re in great shape
to-day, Mr. Ludwig says. Beat him? You’ll flag
him. Oh, I wish I had your speed! I’d make
Sullivan and Keswick look like busted automobiles.
I know just how I’d do it, too. But what’s
the use? I haven’t the speed. I’m only second
string and lucky to be that, but I’ll go through
three hundred yards of that quarter to-day for
every little ounce in me, and I don’t care if they
carry me off afterward.”</p>

<p>The little lad was cuddled up on the floor, back
to a locker, knees up to his chin, bath-robe tucked
in round him. His regard was all for his school
champion. In common with most of the boys of
the school, he had the deepest admiration for
Stevenson’s running power. Never before had
such a quarter-miler come out of Webster—no,
nor out of the state! All he needed was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
more growth and experience and a little more—well,
confidence in himself, and he would beat the
world! So his schoolmates phrased it.</p>

<p>Stevenson placidly accepted Haskin’s devotion.
He had been used to that sort of thing for some
time now, and it did not fluster him. He did not
even acknowledge the care with which his friend
tucked in the wandering folds of his blanket, saying,
“It’s drafty here, Stevie, and you want to keep
your legs covered or you’ll stiffen up. Mustn’t
stiffen up, you know.”</p>

<p>They waited for their time to come—Stevenson
on the mat, Haskins snuggled up against the
locker. The young athletes in the room kept going
and coming. They would go out fresh and strong,
some nervous, some confident, a few absolutely in
fear—ready to draw back only that shame forced
them on. They came back tired, winded, used up,
some of them jubilant, some depressed, a few crying.
With each returning batch some new details
of the progress of things were shouted round the
room.</p>

<p>At last the coach, Ludwig, came back. “Your
quarter’s coming soon, fellows. Looks like Scotia
and Webster again. Sullivan’s just run the two-twenty;
that’ll take the edge off him for the
quarter-mile, Stevenson. How do you feel? And
you, Dickie? It’ll be up to you soon. Feel fit for
the fastest three hundred you ever ran in your life?
Of course you do.”</p>

<p>“I wish Dickie had the other’s speed,” Ludwig
whispered to MacArthur, high jumper and team
captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“H-m-m, Mr. Ludwig—Dickie’s heart and
Stevenson’s legs! Rather a lot for one package,
wouldn’t it be?”</p>

<p>The clerk of the course here made an entrance.
“Quarter-mile comes last of the track events.
Sullivan of Scotia wants to get rested from the
two-twenty, and judges agreed. All out for the
long jump and hammer.”</p>

<p>Stevenson made a pettish face. “I suppose
Sullivan and the Scotians can have things cooked
to their order and the rest of us take what we can
get. I think you ought to protest, Mr. Ludwig.”</p>

<p>Ludwig shook his head. “I can’t change the
order of events, Stevenson. Besides, it’s only fair
to give a man a rest after he’s been through a hard
two-twenty. Take it easy, like Dickie, there. Go
to sleep if you can. Dickie, can’t you find a mat to
lie on? You have an hour to wait yet, and I don’t
like to have you hugging the floor like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is nice. Here’s my suit case for a pillow.
I could go to sleep here.”</p>

<p>All things come to an end. The busy clerk of the
course rushed in for the last time. “Quarter-mile
now! Only one call—all out!”</p>

<p>Stevenson and Dickie promptly rose—Stevenson
anxious in manner, fussy; Dickie serious, calm.
Together they walked across the field, MacArthur
and Ludwig in attendance. Every event had been
finished except the pole-vault, always a lengthy
affair. The audience was in a fine state of expectancy.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the track, Ludwig drew the
boys’ heads together. “Now, Stevenson, this meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
depends on you. We win it if you capture the five
points for first place in the quarter. We lose it if
you don’t. Dickie here is to be sacrificed for you.
Keep your eye on Dickie; he’ll swing out and tell
you when.</p>

<p>“And you, Dickie,” Ludwig went on, “make a
way for Stevenson and balk Keswick. See that you
have the pole on the last turn. Now go along. O
Dickie, a moment!”</p>

<p>Ludwig dropped his arm round the boy’s neck.
“This is in confidence, Dickie. MacArthur and I
are afraid that Stevenson isn’t any too fond of his
job to-day—that he doesn’t quite fancy a tilt with
Sullivan. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Stevenson afraid? Oh, no, Mr. Ludwig!
Stevie’s nervous—that’s natural. Why, I’m nervous,
for all you crack up my coolness. I’m nervous
as I can be, but I try not to show it, and Stevie lets
his out. Stevie will win. Look at him up on his
toes now! Style! He’s won three-quarters of the
crowd already, just the gait of him. Don’t worry,
Mr. Ludwig, Webster’ll win this quarter-mile.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, Dickie. I hope you’re right.
Hope he’s only nervous. Look out for him, anyway.
But don’t try to do it too fast—don’t kill
yourself. If you can, you might just as well finish;
you don’t know, somebody might drop and you
pick up a point. Not much of a chance for you,
but—”</p>

<p>“But Sullivan and Stevie and the rest of them
<em>might</em> drop—used up! Ha, that’s good! Imagine
me a quarter-mile champion! It’s too strange to
think of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Strange things, Dickie. There, that’s for
you.”</p>

<p>In the line of starters Dickie was second from
the pole. Big Keswick was inside him, Stevenson
outside, and Sullivan second outside Stevenson.
Dickie at once made himself acquainted with Keswick’s
tactics. One or two false starts convinced
him that Keswick’s right elbow was intended for a
prominent part in the contest. Dickie knew that
Keswick expected to have it all his own way when
it came to close quarters. But there was a way.
Dickie had no notion of letting Keswick’s cruel
elbow rob him of the pole. There was always a
way to deal with such tactics.</p>

<p>“Starters ready?”</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<p>“Timers ready?”</p>

<p>“Ready—ready, all ready!”</p>

<p>“Get on your marks. Set—stea-a-d-d-y. Come
up. Man at the pole, be careful. Now—on your
marks. Get set—”</p>

<p>Bang! Dickie promptly caught the hook of
Keswick’s plunging right elbow in the angle of his
own left. Keswick was spun half-round and Dickie
shot in. “That for Kessie!” muttered Dickie. The
judges saw it, but it raised only a smile all round
and an appreciative comment from one. “That big
fellow tried it that time, didn’t he? An old trick of
his, Ludwig says, but the little fellow was too
clever.”</p>

<p>Dickie ran like mad for the turn. He got it, with
Stevenson outside him, a little back, and Keswick
directly behind. All the runners turned the curve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in fine style. It promised to be a hot race. The
audience was already applauding vigorously.</p>

<p>Dickie motioned to Stevenson. “I’ll cut loose
the whole length of the back-stretch. Don’t try to
keep up—let Keswick chase me if he cares to;
watch Sullivan, and wait for the turn.” That was
not put in so many words, but had it been written
out, Stevenson could not have read the motions
more plainly.</p>

<p>It was a rare pace that Dickie set. The bunch
tore round the lower curve as if they were to run
only two hundred and twenty yards.</p>

<p>“This is going to be warm,” said a group of old-timers
under the willows.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” yelled the crowd. Dickie had
shot away from the others. Big Keswick was at
his heels. Keswick’s plans had been interfered
with. He was there to take care of Haskins, but
things had been changed. This pace was a
“scorcher.” What did it mean?</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sprint the whole length of the
back-stretch. Dickie was ten yards, Keswick eight
yards in front. Stevenson and Sullivan were running
stride for stride, the Webster man inside, a
yard or two ahead of Sullivan.</p>

<p>Swinging into the upper curve, Dickie signaled
to Stevenson, and then imperceptibly slowed up the
pace. Keswick naturally trailed behind. Without
understanding how it was brought about, he
felt the relief, and was well content to take it.
Dickie knew Keswick was in no trim to interfere
with what was soon going to happen.</p>

<p>Dickie felt Stevenson coming easily. Again he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
signaled, this time looking back to see that all was
well. Stevenson moved up to Keswick’s flank and
nodded. The last turn was before them. Dickie,
suddenly darting forward, opened up several yards.
Keswick was too surprised and too tired to understand
at once. Stevenson strode past him and
dropped into Dickie’s tracks. Dickie, on the corner,
swung wide and Stevenson slid inside. The
pole and the lead were his.</p>

<p>Sullivan had his choice of following Stevenson
or running outside Dickie. He chose to follow
Stevenson. To let him by, Keswick was compelled
to pull up and lose his chance for a place. Dickie,
seeing how Sullivan had chosen, promptly dropped
back a yard to Sullivan’s flank. That put Sullivan
in a close pocket.</p>

<p>It was all most prettily done. The grand stand
got up on its toes to cheer it. The experts under
the willows hurled big words of praise out to
Dickie.</p>

<p>After that maneuver, Dickie felt that he had no
more strength left. It was an immense relief to
him to think that the strain of his work was past,
and that Stevie was in a good way now to win the
race. But he must give a final word of cheer to
Stevie before he was left behind.</p>

<p>“Go in, Steve, go in now! That’s the boy! All
right, you’ve got it cinched. Go on! What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>Dickie, looking up at his chum’s face, saw an
expression that made his heart sink. There was
despair in Stevenson’s eyes.</p>

<p>Others saw, and understood. From under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
willows came encouraging cries to Sullivan: “Go
in, Scotia! You’ve got him! He’s all in! He’s
a quitter, anyway, and the little fellow’s used up.
Come out of that box, Sully, and win!”</p>

<p>Dickie heard this. Stevenson heard it, too, and
it did him no good. Sullivan heard, also, and acted
on it. He worked out of the pocket to Dickie’s
side. Dickie looked at Sullivan, saw only a grim
resolve there, and in despair appealed to Stevenson.</p>

<p>“O Stevie, go in! Only half the stretch! You
can do it! Go in!”</p>

<p>Stevenson made no answer, but to Dickie’s dismay,
fell down, as if exhausted, on the grass.</p>

<p>Dickie, without looking again, felt the courage
of the Scotian beside him. There was no giving in
there. The race was lost!</p>

<p>But was it lost? He did what had never entered
his head until that instant. The import of Ludwig’s
last words flashed on him. Had Stevenson
really quit? He did not seem used up. And after
everything had worked so nicely! What a shame
for Webster!</p>

<p>It was in the blindest kind of way that Dickie
pegged on beside Sullivan. Only for that work
on the turn and Sullivan would have been yards
ahead! What a runner this Sullivan was! Dickie
was marveling that he held up with him.</p>

<p>The audience was marveling, too. They were
frantic, some for Sullivan, but most for Dickie,
because he was so small and had borne his previous
share so nobly. Their yells were deafening. But
Dickie never heard them. He was taken up with
a different thing—with the unbearable strain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the race. Every nerve in his body quivered under
the rack of his effort. Every little molecule and
atom was crying out with the torture of it—but
would not Webster be disgraced if he did not win?
He knew what they would all say. Could he make
it? Still behind—what a hard fighter—this Sullivan!
He would never underrate a Scotian again.</p>

<p>One foot and twenty yards to go. Now then!
No use. O Dickie! Who called? All Webster
was calling. O Dickie! What a horrible thing!
Hot, heavy iron in his loins—great lead weights on
his feet—and his chest! What an awful collapse
in his chest! Would it hold out? And his knees—if
they would but keep off the ground he would
win yet.</p>

<p>A foot, still a foot—what an awful lot to make
up! Half a foot! Was Sullivan going, too? Ten
yards—even! Was it even? Was it worth this
awful agony? Even—one more, two more, another—and—sh-h-h!</p>

<p>It was the frenzied Ludwig who caught him as
he fell. And it was Ludwig and MacArthur who
bore him in a blanket across the field and laid him
on two thicknesses of mats in the athletic building.
It was these two, and a doctor from among the
officials, who worked on him until he knew where
he was.</p>

<p>It was Ludwig on one side, sponging his face,
and MacArthur on the other, drying him off, when
he looked up with the first sign of intelligence.</p>

<p>“There you are, you little bronco! Changed
your mind and came back to life, did you? Know
what we’ve a good mind to do to you? A little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
this, now—there, how’s that? That’s witch-hazel
we’re rubbing on. Sniff it up, that’s right. Fine,
eh? Feel better than when you crossed the tape-rather!
Get up? Not for a while yet—not till
the carriage comes.</p>

<p>“Who won? Why, you, of course!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know. I was almost afraid to ask—afraid
it was Sullivan. Last I remember he was
ahead. Couldn’t see—”</p>

<p>“Ahead? I should say he was ahead until a
yard from the string, and then a miracle happened.
Of course you couldn’t see. Wonder you could
breathe after that finish—and setting the pace all
the way round! Why, your knees weren’t six
inches off the ground! You crossed on your hands
and knees—crossed, no, you never crossed—you
fell over, and Sullivan fell alongside. Wait till
Webster gets hold of you.”</p>

<p>“Poor Sullivan, wasn’t he game? And we beat
Scotia?”</p>

<p>“Beat them, yes, and won the banner—champions
again.”</p>

<p>“Won the banner—that’s good. And Richard
L. Haskins won the quarter. That’ll look fine in
the morning paper. Won’t the people at home
read that, though? But, Mr. Ludwig—Stevie—how’s
Stevie?”</p>

<p>“Stevenson’s all right. No, lie down—he’s not
here. He’s gone to the station to catch an early
train home.”</p>

<p>“Poor Stevie—I know—you don’t want to tell
me,” whispered Dickie.</p>

<p>“Now, now, Dickie, I’ll handle the sponge.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Ludwig bent lower. “Sh-h-h! There, there, let
Mac pull the hood over, and nobody will know. Go
ahead, don’t mind me and Mac; we understand.”</p>

<p>Ludwig plied the sponge and MacArthur the
towel. And so deftly did they work that in all that
room no other knew that under the hood of the
bath-robe they were wiping away Dickie’s tears of
pity for Stevenson.</p>

<h2 id="HOLDING_THE_PIPE">HOLDING THE PIPE</h2>

<p class="author">By Albert W. Tolman</p>

<p class="dropcap">As the father of Billy and Jack Remfry
emerged from the sitting-room closet with the
checker-board, the two boys sidled up to him. Billy
hugged an armful of rockets, while Jack was
generously laden with firecrackers and Roman
candles. “Aren’t you going with us to Steel
Bridge? You promised.”</p>

<p>Tom Remfry hesitated. Fourth of July night
though it was, he could not forego his weekly battle
with Lon Penfield, his fellow fireman and ancient
checker foe. So he compromised. “Run along,
boys. I’ll come after just one game. Don’t point
those rockets toward the city.”</p>

<p>Whooping, the boys made off. Tom and Lon
sat down to the board, undisturbed by the noise outside.
This game was unusually important, for
Lon’s victory the Saturday before had tied them
with seventeen apiece.</p>

<p>While they whittled down each other’s forces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Henry Marcot, watchman in Bustin’s lumber-yard,
was uneasily watching three boys with firecrackers
just outside the fence. So engrossed was Henry
with the foe in front that he did not observe a flaming
rocket-stick which, after soaring far and high,
dropped quietly upon a hard-pine board-pile behind
him. Startled by a sudden crackling, he
looked back to see the whole pile ablaze.</p>

<p>When the rocket fell, Remfry’s four kings were
beleaguering Penfield’s remaining three in the latter’s
dodge-corner. Marcot pulled the yard alarm
just as an incautious onslaught cost the besieger two
pieces to his enemy’s one, and left the game a draw.</p>

<p><em>Clang! Clang!</em></p>

<p>Over went the board and up leaped both call-men.
Out they darted, Remfry snapping his
spring-lock, and ran at top speed for the house of
Hose 5. The cart was rattling into the street when
they jumped abroad.</p>

<p>“Where’s the fire?” halloed Remfry to Louville
Craig, his elbow neighbor on the swaying wagon.</p>

<p>“Bustin’s lumber-yard!” Craig shouted. “They
say a rocket from Steel Bridge started it.”</p>

<p>Remfry caught his breath as if doused with cold
water. Steel Bridge! One of his boys’ rockets!
His heart went down like lead. Oh, why had he
not gone with them and given up his game! But
it was too late now. That very thing had been the
nightmare of the fire department ever since he
joined it—a blaze in the worst place and under the
worst conditions.</p>

<p>The city stood west of the river on three terraces.
The first contained lumber-yards, coal-sheds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mills; the second, thirty feet higher, held the railroad-tracks
and business section; while the third,
thirty feet higher still, was covered with residences.
Unless the flames were checked, the east wind
would drive them against an oil-tank right above
the yard on the edge of the second terrace. That
once afire, the whole city might be wiped out.</p>

<p>As Hose 5 clattered across the railroad gridiron
between hurrying crowds, Remfry sighted the yard,
and felt sick. The pine was blazing fiercely, sending
out a dense yellowish-black smoke. The second
alarm began to clang, calling out the whole
force.</p>

<p>The cart stopped near the engine, which was
already in position. The two call-men rapidly
donned rubber coats and helmets, while their mates
took the butt of the hose off the wagon and rushed
it to the hydrant.</p>

<p>“Run a line up Adams Street, you two, back of
the yard!” shouted Capt. Joe Porter. It was the
post of responsibility in the very track of the flames,
and he picked his best men for it. Penfield and
Remfry again jumped on the hose-cart.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” yelled the hydrant man to the
driver. Off rattled the wagon, dropping a lengthening
trail of hose. The instant they stopped, the
firemen screwed on the pipe and began to drag the
line toward the yard.</p>

<p>Close by stood the oil-tank, big and black, with
the smoke eddying thickly round it. Thirty feet
below lay the lumber piles. Dropping their hose
over the edge of the stone wall, they slid down to
the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Play away, 5!” shouted Remfry, pulling down
more line. They were in a space between high
board-piles, and a strong wind was driving the fire
and smoke toward them. The spot might easily
become a dangerous trap.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom!” bellowed Penfield, tugging at
the pipe. “Let’s get well in before the water
comes.”</p>

<p>The piles were twenty feet apart. Round a corner
twice as far ahead red tongues were spurting.
Already the air was hot and thick. Crouching, they
dragged the line along several yards. Remfry was
wild with impatience. He was responsible for that
fire. He must put it out.</p>

<p>“Far enough!” he gasped at last. “Isn’t that
water ever coming?”</p>

<p>It was fully five hundred feet to the engine. A
few lengths from it the three-inch hose was “Siamesed”
off into two smaller lines, one of which ran to
the impatient call-men. Suddenly a tremor shook
the closely woven cotton.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” exclaimed Penfield.</p>

<p><em>Psht! Psht!</em> hissed the nozzle. Spasmodically at
first, but in a few seconds foaming strongly under
a two-hundred pound pressure, the water came.
The two rested the pipe over their knees, grasping
the handles firmly, interlocking fingers under the
tip. A powerful white jet was soon bombarding
the burning pine.</p>

<p>The hose stiffened under their hands, responsive
to every impulse from the engine. It was like a
live thing, struggling to escape. But they knew
its tricks, and held it hard. Three years they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
been together on the pipe, and never once had it
got away from them.</p>

<p>At the very apex of the fire they literally held the
safety of the city in their hands. Behind them
loomed the gaunt, black oil-tank. Should the
flames reach its ten thousand gallons nothing could
save the city.</p>

<p>Remfry groaned at the thought. He envied Penfield.
Penfield had only the fire to think of. That
was bad enough, to be sure. But it was tenfold
worse for him, Tom Remfry, to feel that he might
have prevented all this, had he only gone to Steel
Bridge with his boys.</p>

<p>Low as they might stoop, they could not avoid
the smoke. Their smarting eyes could barely see
to direct the jet. Both were choking. Penfield
leaned forward and thrust his hand into the stream
to spray his face.</p>

<p>His foot slipped; he lost his balance; his grip
on the handle loosened.</p>

<p>With a tremendous leap the pipe wrenched out
of the men’s grasp, and disappeared straight up in
the thick smoke.</p>

<p>A deluge burst above the firemen. The hose
had changed from their best friend to their worst
enemy. It whipped the board-piles; it slapped full
length on the ground to their right; vanishing, it
dropped a moment later on their left. Fearful in
plain sight, it was doubly, trebly terrible in that
impenetrable pitchiness. One rap from the crazy
nozzle would smash a man’s skull.</p>

<p>Remfry grabbed Penfield’s shoulder. Their first
impulse was to run; but where? Straight ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was the only way out; and the fire barred that.
Behind rose the thirty-foot wall.</p>

<p>Instinct told Remfry the only spot where for a
brief period they might be comparatively safe.</p>

<p>“Back to the corner!” he whispered, hoarsely;
and the two ran for their lives. Once the nozzle
jabbed Penfield in the spine. Then Remfry ducked
in time to lose only his helmet from a flying loop
of hose. Soon they were crouching in the angle
between the wall and a board-pile.</p>

<p>But the flames would soon drive them from this
refuge. Besides, the chief counted on them to fight
back the fire from the oil-tank. The force had its
hands full. Every man and every line were busy.
Somehow they must signal the engine to shut the
water off, until they could regain control of the
pipe.</p>

<p>“Hold on, 5!” shrieked Remfry. And Penfield
seconded him with:</p>

<p>“Shut that line down!”</p>

<p>But no answering cry came back. It was not
strange. Two men under a high wall, throats full
of smoke and cinders, could hardly make themselves
heard above the roar of the flames and the hissing
of water, capped by the whirring and puffing of
seven engines.</p>

<p>Desperate as was their own situation, the firemen’s
first thought was of the ruin threatened by
the fire. The destruction of the lumber-yard was
bad enough, but the whole city—every business
block, every dwelling, their own homes—it was horrible!
Remfry remembered he had just paid for
his house, and that he had no insurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the fire was growing hotter; shriveling
blasts swept against the wall. Hot, stinging
pitch-pine smoke filled their eyes and lungs. The
nozzle was vainly cascading every spot except the
one that needed it. It maddened Remfry to see
so much good water wasting. Every gallon was
priceless. He could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>“No use, Lon!” he croaked, putting his mouth
dose to his comrade’s ear. “We can’t make ’em
hear. We’ve got to catch that pipe.”</p>

<p>Both knew well the peril they risked. Three
months before had not a flying nozzle snapped Billy
Bowen’s leg! But they must take chances. Remfry
slunk along the right-hand board-pile; Penfield
followed the left. Should one get his hands on the
hose, the other was to spring to his help.</p>

<p>The dense smoke thinned, and they glimpsed the
line, slatting like a maddened python. Three or
four clutches at the elusive loops resulted only in
their being flung down and dragged in the dirt.</p>

<p>Through those moments of exhausting struggle,
of harrowing suspense, dread of the fire creeping
ever nearer the oil, destruction menacing the entire
city, Remfry’s brain was busy with the terrible
thought that he and his boys were responsible for
it all.</p>

<p>The clouds lifted. Remfry saw the coil whip
toward Penfield. There came a thud. Lon was
swept off his feet, and dashed against the board-pile.
Dropping like a lump of clay, he lay motionless.
Remfry thought his mate was killed. He
faced the hose with sudden fury.</p>

<p>Just then it caught for an instant under the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of a board. His chance! Hurling himself upon it,
he wound both arms about the swelling tube just
as it got away again.</p>

<p>Twining arms and legs round the hose, he hitched
slowly forward. The whole thing now was on him,
<em>him</em>! Lon could not help any more. Inch by inch
he crept along the squirming tube, hugging it bearishly.
It flirted him from one side to the other,
rolling him in the dirt. It humped itself like a bucking
bronco. Once it tossed him against the boards,
almost fracturing his ribs. In spite of all he did
not let go; for he knew he could never get hold
again.</p>

<p>A weak cry made him look back. Under the
smoke he caught sight of Penfield, struggling to
rise. He had only been stunned. A great weight
fell from Remfry’s mind, and he clung with fresh
strength.</p>

<p>“Take your time, Lon!” he shouted. “I’ll hold
it down.”</p>

<p>Huge, black, formless, fiery-eyed, spitting forky
flame, the conflagration overshadowed him, like a
gigantic Chinese dragon, the spirit of ruin personified.
Against its searing breath he crawled, now
prone, now tossed aloft, battered, smoke-stifled, but
creeping steadily on.</p>

<p>The end of the big tube was not far away. Remfry
could tell that, for its oscillations were growing
shorter and more violent. The part conquered lay
quiet behind him. But somewhere in the smoke in
front the metal pipe was brandishing like the snapper
of a whip-lash.</p>

<p>With lightning suddenness down it smashed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the hose not three inches before his fingers. Had it
struck his hand, it would have splintered every bone.
The polished brass glinted as it gyrated wildly
away. The next few feet would be the most perilous,
for at any second the nozzle might crack his
skull.</p>

<p>The hot black smoke puffed along the ground·
Remfry butted blindly into it, lowering his face, till
his lips brushed the dirt. Inch after inch of hard
round tube slipped back under him and grew quiet.
With eyes closed tight he wriggled on. When he
was within a yard of the pipe, he knew it would
stop slatting.</p>

<p>The moment came sooner than he had expected.
With one final flirt the nozzle gave up, conquered,
and the jet began to furrow the chips and dirt. A
second later Remfry’s fingers touched the brass
handles.</p>

<p>Soon Penfield was beside him, his strength and
consciousness fully restored; and they took up
once more their battle with the flames.</p>

<p>It was well toward morning before the fire was
out, and the two started for home. Remfry felt
better. The city was safe. Still the thousands of
dollars’ worth of lumber that had gone up in smoke
hung, a black, heavy pall, above his conscience.
He dreaded to meet Jack and Billy.</p>

<p>As he stumbled on, a sentence from a passer-by
caught his ear:</p>

<p>“Started by a rocket from Triangle Hill, across
the river.”</p>

<p>He gripped the man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” he almost shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” briefly rejoined the stranger, looking in
surprise at his begrimed, excited questioner.</p>

<p>Remfry dropped his arm. So his boys were not
responsible, after all. Bruised, muddy, saturated
with pitch-pine smoke, every muscle aching, he resumed
his way homeward, his mind at peace.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TRAVELLING_DOLL">THE TRAVELLING DOLL</h2>

<p class="author">By Evelyn Snead Barnett</p>

<p class="dropcap">Before the serpent came in the guise of a
French doll, it was a gay little Eden of a
shanty-boat. Its doors were plaid-paneled in red,
green and blue; its tiny square window-frames
were painted blue on one side of the house, red
on the other, and green at the back. Here, to be
sure, the paint grew thin and failed to hold out for
the walls, although gathering with a mixture of its
three tints it sprawled in a final effort to tell that
the name of the little home was <i>The Wing</i>.</p>

<p>But a short distance from the mainland <i>The
Wing</i> rested, anchored to a green island. A skiff
was tied to its front mast and a single plank connected
the shanty-boat with the great world—typical
of the slender thread that bound the floating
family to their kind, for the Wings did not consort
with other shanty-boaters.</p>

<p>Inside, the little abode was as gay as its exterior,
and far more tidy. The stove and its tins were
polished “to the nines,” the strips of rag carpet
were bright and clean, the table was scoured white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the bed was neatly made, and under it the family
wardrobe was out of sight in a long, black, brass-nailed
box. A gaudy clock ticked noisily from a
shelf; a tall lamp, in a rainbow-paper shade, the
pride and glory of the home, sat by its side. The
wall was covered with bright posters; everywhere
were gay colors and shining cleanliness.</p>

<p>And they were a satisfied family,—before the
serpent came,—Father Wing being a sturdy, silent
fisherman, who could always be counted upon to
make a living, catching it on water and spending it
on land, and finding comfort in his gentle wife and
ten-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>To-day he was off fishing, and Mrs. Wing sat
inside the sill of the plaid doorway, sewing on a
high-necked, long-sleeved gingham apron, her head
turned in a listening attitude that was habitual.
Outside on the little deck piazza, in a starched mate
to the apron her mother was making, little Almira
sat, hugging Botsey and feeling rather lonely; for
although her father had left the skiff and taken
Wally Jim away, Sweepins had surreptitiously
followed.</p>

<p>Almira was barelegged and towheaded, but she
had a fair skin that defied exposure, and her face
had never lost its baby curves. Her eyes were as
blue as the river on a clear day, and her mouth had
a tender droop, as if she were always feeling sorry
for something or some one. She was tilting her
little stool, humming a song to Botsey, when her
mother said:</p>

<p>“I hear voices. Who’s on shore, Almira?”</p>

<p>Almira looked. “They’s two of ’em, ma. They’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
beck’ning me to come for ’em. One’s Miss May,
and the other’s got lace on her petticoat and fuzzy
things round her neck.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Miss May’s coming about school again.
I’m going to show her that last copy of yours. I
wish I could spare you to get an education like my
mother gave me, but I can’t. Still, it ain’t every
child with eyes can read raised point.”</p>

<p>Almira was untying the boat. “I wouldn’t let
you spare me. You’d catch afire or you’d fall into
the river. We’d rather stay here, wouldn’t we?”
She was talking to Botsey now. “No, you can’t
go with me.” Jumping nimbly into the skiff, she
began to cross the narrow strip of water.</p>

<p>“That baby row us?” she heard the lace lady ask.
So she ran the boat in skilfully.</p>

<p>Miss May stepped lightly in; the lace lady hesitated,
then followed with a laugh. Almira could
hardly work the oars for looking at her soft brown
eyes and the little brown curl that fluttered on her
cheek.</p>

<p>A few strokes brought the skiff to the boat.
“Good morning, Mrs. Wing!” called Miss May.
“Here’s somebody you want to meet. Guess!”</p>

<p>“Is it Mrs. Lenox, who sends the raised point
books in the travelling library?”</p>

<p>“You’re a witch!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>The woman smiled brightly. Her blue eyes, with
the white, sightless pupils, turned toward the
stranger. “I’m glad to see you at last. We heard
you were coming. Almira, have you brought seats
for the ladies?”</p>

<p>The child, keeping her eyes on the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
stranger, brought forward two soap-boxes upholstered
in gay calico. If Botsey only had something
like that for her neck! And she caught up the
bottle in its crude skirt and blue crocheted shawl
with an emphatic hug.</p>

<p>“Is that your doll?” asked Mrs. Lenox·</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. It’s Botsey.”</p>

<p>“It’s the bottle I’ve fixed up for her. I don’t
know how she’d pass the time if it wasn’t for Botsey.
You see, being so helpless, I try to make her
enjoy staying with me. You know how helpless I
am without her, Miss May.”</p>

<p>“I know how helpful you are and what a good
housekeeper,” said Miss May, looking about at the
tidy interior.</p>

<p>Then she told her errand. Almira was invited to
the schoolhouse reception party the next Wednesday.
Wally Jim had offered to fish near <i>The
Wing</i>, if Mr. Wing should have to be filling orders
in town.</p>

<p>Almira, her eyes still fixed on the beautiful lady’s
face, said, “I went once. Miss May had an Easter
just after we first come here. May I bring
Botsey?”</p>

<p>But Miss May said no. A new library was due,
and if it reached the village in time Almira would
have books to bring her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wing smiled softly. “How good of you!
The last one was about little Nell. Why is it our
books are so much better than books for people that
can see? Jack thinks so, and so does Almira. How
I bless you, ma’am!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lenox could say nothing. May had told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
her the story of the young mother, attacked by the
scarlet fever that left her sightless ten years before.</p>

<p>“I’ll let her come on Wednesday,” pursued Mrs.
Wing, “but I’ll never budge from this chair till she
gits back. It’s not as if I’d never seen how dangerous
things are.”</p>

<p class="tb">With the school party this tale has naught to do.
The child reached home betimes, carrying a package
of books and a pasteboard box that seemed
almost as long as herself. She was trembling with
excitement.</p>

<p>“The library’s come, ma! And here’s two books
and some cake and candy and—O ma, just guess
what’s in the box?”</p>

<p>The mother felt, smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“A little girl—a live little girl-baby doll!” And
she lifted it from its shell. “And Miss May—she’s
sometimes so funny!—she said at first she believed
she’d rather I wouldn’t have her, but the lady said
she wanted me to.”</p>

<p>The mother held out her arms for the doll, almost
as excited as the child.</p>

<p>Almira expounded, “Its dress is blue, with buttons
and buttonholes, and her hair’s real; put your
hand here. It’s brown, and these teenty brown
curls slant on her cheeks, and her eyes are brown,
and she can shut them and go to sleep just like you
and me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said the mother, feeling. “And
what is this paper pinned on her dress?”</p>

<p>“It’s a letter,” answered Almira, sagely. “It
begins in print and ends in writing, but I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
make it all out. It says, ‘Patent, unbreakable,
celluloid. Made in France.’ I’ll ask daddy the
rest when he comes. And feel the petticoat, ma!
Lace!”</p>

<p>“And tucks,” added the mother. “And see how
fine the stuff is. Are these slippers?”</p>

<p>“With heels, real heels!” gurgled Almira. “And
stockin’s! And in the box here’s a hat and feather
and a white nightgown!” Almira’s emotion got
the better of her, and she flung herself into her
mother’s arms and rocked in ecstasy.</p>

<p>Then came a familiar bark, and Sweepins preceded
the husband and fell to sniffing the doll immediately.
“It’s mine, Sweepins,” cried the child.
“Look, daddy!”</p>

<p>But the fisherman was too hungry to notice dolls,
so the trio prepared the supper of frizzled bacon,
corn, hoe-cakes and weak coffee. Afterward was
bedtime, and the little feather bed was pulled from
the big one to the floor, and made up with clean
quilts for the child. But first she undressed the
doll, carefully plaiting its hair in two nice plaits,
putting the front in curl-papers, and robing it in
the night-dress fine enough for day. Mrs. Lenox
had cautioned her to teach her child tidy ways like
its grandmother’s. Poor Botsey, hitherto her constant
bedfellow, stood motionless outside the door.</p>

<p>When morning came, and she was helping, her
mother asked, “What are you going to name her?”</p>

<p>“It ought to be something pretty. I thought
of Queeny.”</p>

<p>“Queeny’ll be fine,” agreed Mrs. Wing. “But
where’s the paper? Maybe she’s already named.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Outside “daddy” was mending a net when Almira
brought him the paper. He read:</p>

<p>“‘Patent, unbreakable, celluloid. Made in
France.’ That’s in print, and here in writing is,
‘This travelling doll goes with Travelling Library
Number Ten to any child selected by persons responsible
for the distribution of the books. It is
the reward for good behavior or special merit in
the place of a medal, and is to belong to the child
until the library is ready to go on, when the dolly
in neat condition and clean, her hair combed, her
clothing washed and ironed, must be put back in
her box and packed for the next child on the
circuit.’”</p>

<p>Almira snatched at the paper and ran into the
boat. She laid Queeny on her mother’s lap and
crept out to the little deck. Botsey, again on guard,
stood by the door. Almira seized her fiercely, tore
off the blue shawl, dragged at the soiled skirt. An
old greasy bottle! How could it ever be taken
back as her very own child when Queeny had to
go?</p>

<p>“Almira,” called the mother, scenting tragedy,
“don’t you want me to play grandmother with you
and Queeny?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? She’s like your books. She
ain’t mine, and I never had a real child before.
The paper says she must travel with the books.”</p>

<p>But the placid cheeriness of the blind woman
smoothed matters: “But she’s yours now, and
sometimes the books stay for weeks and weeks.”</p>

<p>Here was some comfort. One week was a long
time; a month so long that Almira could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
remember it. And Queeny was beautiful. Why
not love her and be happy?</p>

<p>And she was, for weeks and weeks that went by
like a dream. She quite forgot what had to happen
until one day Wally Jim stopped with a note from
Miss May—in printing writing that Almira could
read. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will you let Queeny go on to-morrow? There’s
a dear little girl just your age up in the mountains
who may have to walk on crutches all her life. She
is expecting the doll every day now, so have it looking
clean and pretty.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Almira?” questioned the mother. But the child
did not answer. Fortunately no one was near but
Wally Jim to see her screwed-up face as she gulped
once or twice. She handed him the paper to read,
making a sign of silence. Whatever her emotions,
she always instinctively spared her sympathetic
mother.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let her go!” blurted Wally Jim, kicking
one cowhide boot so hard against the tying-post
that he rocked the house.</p>

<p>Almira’s head shook in mournful dissent.
“When I took her I knew I had to let her travel
with the books,” she said, with wonderful logic.</p>

<p>Wally Jim would not look at her. “You take
my advice—kick about it. ’Twon’t do any harm.”
He got into his skiff, with head turned from
Almira’s drawn face. “But if you’re bound to
send her, I’ll be round to-morrow for her and the
books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that he said about the books?” called
the mother. “Are some more coming?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. These have to go back.”</p>

<p>“And the doll? O baby!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Almira, shortly. “We’ll
wash her clothes to-day, for it says, ‘Returned clean
and neat.’”</p>

<p>It was all right while the work went on. Queeny
was washed, combed, braided and dressed. Almira
touched her as little as possible.</p>

<p>When Queeny was laid in her box, wearing a
blue hood knitted by the mother, and tied with the
tapes that had held her still on her former journey,
Almira thought she looked as if she were in her
coffin. Then Almira caught sight of Botsey, as
usual on guard outside the door. Before Queeny
came Botsey was ever so much sweeter. If she had
never seen Queeny! Why could not the little girl
in the mountains on crutches have a Botsey? They
do all right until you’ve seen the other kind.</p>

<p>Almira’s character was one of quick decision.
With a furtive look at her mother, she took Queeny
from her nest and removed her hood, dress, shoes,
stockings. Then she stripped Botsey of her old
skirt and blue shawl, putting Queeny’s clothes on
Botsey after a painful fashion, put the blue woolen
hood over Botsey’s green glass countenance, and
folded Queeny’s freshly starched nightgown on
Botsey’s chest. She viewed her work critically,
and with an access of turpitude, stuffed empty
sleeves and stockings with paper, putting on the
slippers so that they stuck quite naturally from
beneath the blue frock: and right over the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
where Queeny’s face should have looked from the
hood, she pinned the paper. Then she tied the
tapes, tied them with a vicious screw of her mouth
in hard, hard knots, put the lid on the box, and
brought all to her mother, saying, in the evenest
of tones:</p>

<p>“I want you to help me wrap her up.”</p>

<p>“Poor baby!” said the mother. “Maybe some
day Mrs. Lenox will send another.”</p>

<p>“Never want another!” said the child, sullenly.</p>

<p>Going out to her stool in front, she dressed
Queeny in the old skirt, put the shawl over her
head, and tried to stand her on guard, Botsey
fashion. But Queeny doubled up, and refused.
So she held her in her arms with a savage satisfaction,
thinking, “Queeny isn’t any bottle doll.”</p>

<p>Once the mother brushed the wool of the little
shawl as the child passed her on some household
task.</p>

<p>“You’ve done gone back to Botsey? That’s
right. You’ve the sense of a grown-up.”</p>

<p>The afternoon brought a scare. Miss May herself
came for the packages. Suppose! Oh, suppose!
Almira barely had time to plump Queeny between
the feather beds before Miss May landed in Wally
Jim’s skiff. Almira was glad that she had been
prompt, and that the string was tied in hard knots.
Miss May praised her for being a good little girl,
and made her wince by depicting the gladness of
that lame child in the mountains when Queeny
should arrive.</p>

<p>But Almira did not repent for a minute. She
even said, “Poor little girl!” with a hard-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
irony. Miss May puckered her forehead, as she
always did when she was thinking.</p>

<p>That night Almira tossed and tumbled, unable
to sleep. Then the moon rose and sent a straight
shaft of light through one of the little square windows
on the doll’s face. Almira smothered a
scream. One of Queeny’s eyes was asleep, the other
wide open, staring at her. She shook her hard, but
that eye would not sleep. She held her up, but
although the shut eye opened, the open eye shut,
giving the effect of a wicked wink.</p>

<p>How she longed for dear, blind Botsey! Where
was Botsey now? Could she feel, and did she know
what had been done? No, Botsey was only a bottle.</p>

<p>But <em>Queeny knew</em>! And Queeny was watching
her with one eye to see what other wicked things
were going to happen; and there was Miss May
praising her and trusting her, and that little lame
girl in the mountains expecting a doll, and
getting—</p>

<p>Almira could not have called this a protest of
conscience, but she knew she was utterly miserable.
Furthermore, she realized that Queeny’s ability to
bring pride and happiness was gone, and that she
herself would always have this something gnawing
her inside.</p>

<p>But must she? Perhaps it was not too late.
Jim would help her. To-morrow she would get
him to stay near her mother while she went ashore
with Queeny, the glaring Queeny, to Miss May,
telling her how bad she had been. Perhaps Number
Ten had not gone on, and Botsey could be
stopped on her deceitful way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>This resolve so comforted Almira that as the
moon went down and darkness hid the staring eye,
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She was awakened by voices and a motion she
knew well. The daylight came broadly through
the windows. She heard a clanging and creaking.</p>

<p>A sick realization overwhelmed her. They had
left the island, they were in the broad bed of the
river, skimming away who knew where?—away
from Miss May and the chance of making things
all right.</p>

<p>She dressed herself, asking no questions; but
her mother, holding to the arms of her chair, explained:</p>

<p>“Your pa thinks he’ll do better off a larger
town, so he came in before day and raised sail to
get into the current while this good wind’s blowing.”</p>

<p>Almira sat limply on her little stool. Queeny
could not go back to Miss May, but she should
not glare at her with her one eye for the rest of
her life. Botsey could swim, but Queeny—Queeny
could drown! And this time there was no deliberation.
She snatched at the doll, and going to the
back of the boat, hurled it as far as she could into
the river!</p>

<p>Then she fell to helping her mother assiduously,
being extra loving and attentive, giving little pats
and squeezes as she passed her in her morning
tasks, even running to hug her whenever the boat
rocked in the waves made by passing craft. Mrs.
Wing did the washing, Almira hung the clothes
to dry in the bright, breezy sunshine. She scoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the already bright tins, she shook up the beds,
hung the quilts to air, washed the floor, the deck.
It was work she wanted, hard work. She made
the discovery that work brought forgetfulness.
She would have liked to scrub the floor of the
world.</p>

<p>Day was all right, but for all her bodily fatigue
she slept but fitfully that night. She wished people
could work at night.</p>

<p>Although they soon reached a place that her
father called the Point, and anchored a little way
up a creek, where things stopped shaking and were
quiet, her eyes would not close.</p>

<p>This Point place was not like the green island.
There were smells. They were far enough inland
to see a street with people walking; indeed, they
were almost under a bridge that let the street-cars
go by. “Daddy” left early. After putting the
cabbage on to boil, her mother sat down to her
seams and hems in the checked blue gingham. Almira,
empty-handed, moped on her little three-legged
stool at the door. Sweepins, wringing wet,
snored on the sunny deck.</p>

<p>A skiff came up the stream; in it Wally Jim.
“I’ve brought you something!” he called. “Miss
May got to thinking after she got home, and she
says she’ll get another doll for that mountain kid,
and you can have Queeny back.” He reached under
the seat, and with dramatic effect drew out the
long box.</p>

<p>At the sight of it Almira’s self-control gave way.
Here was punishment, indeed! To her mother’s
arms she rushed, blurting out the truth with sobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wally Jim,” asked Mrs. Wing, “how far is
Miss May’s from here?”</p>

<p>“Not so very far, and she’s down in town to-day—said
she was coming.”</p>

<p>“Take the box back to her, Wally Jim!” sobbed
Almira. “Let her see it just as it is, because she
hasn’t opened it, and she thinks she’s sending me
Queeny. And I’ll write a letter besides.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take all the letters you want, but I won’t
take the box, because whatever’s in it, it’s yours.”
There was something different and set about Wally
Jim this morning. Almira sighed resignedly, and
with painstaking labor proceeded to print her letter
of repentance.</p>

<p>“You have got back Botsey, dear,” said the
mother, “so try to forget.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never play with Botsey again. I’ll give her
away first.”</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time they heard Jim’s oars
again, and Miss May stepped on deck. She was
holding out her arms to Almira, and there were
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Dear child, I didn’t like the idea from the very
first, but Mrs. Lenox does so much for us. You’ll
be all the better for the sharp experience, and you
have really shown your repentance. Now let’s
open the box and see exactly what you did.”</p>

<p>Quite cheerfully, all the miserable feeling gone,
Almira brought scissors, cut strings, pointing out
the while the iniquities of hard knots and covered
features.</p>

<p>What! Queeny! From the bottom of the river,
dry, clothed, and with her two eyes shut! Almira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
looked at Miss May and at Wally Jim, grinning
over Miss May’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“What has happened now?” asked Mrs. Wing.</p>

<p>“Tell your story, Jim,” said Miss May.</p>

<p>“I was drifting some way off behind you all,” said
Jim, “and maybe sleeping some, when who should
swim up to the skiff with something in his mouth
but Sweepins. It was Queeny, but as she’s cellyloid,
only her clothes were wet. I puzzled out that somehow
she hadn’t gone back to Miss May, and that she
ought to. So I took her, and Miss May says, ‘If
this is Queeny, what’s in Almira’s box?’ And we
looked, and there was Botsey.”</p>

<p>“And oh, I was so sorry,” said Miss May, taking
up the tale, “though I’d known all along that a travelling
doll would cause heartache—and this proved
it would do worse. I sent Queeny back, after having
her doctored, knowing that my little Almira was
good before temptation came, and wishing to know
what it had made of her. I’m satisfied,” and Miss
May hugged the child once more.</p>

<p>The blind mother was smiling. “Miss May, she’s
only a child, you know, but she suffered like a
grown-up, and with it all, helped me just the same
as ever.”</p>

<p>Almira dug her bare toes into the rag carpet.
“Where’d Botsey go to?” she asked, without looking
up.</p>

<p>“If I were you, I’d look under the seat of my
boat,” said Wally Jim.</p>

<h2 id="THE_DOLL_DOCTOR">THE DOLL DOCTOR</h2>

<p class="author">By E. V. Lucas</p>

<p class="dropcap">Christina’s father was as good as his
word—the doll came, by post, in a long wooden
box, only three days after he had left for Paris.
All the best dolls come from Paris, but you have
to call them “poupées” there when you ask the
young ladies in the shops for them.</p>

<p>Christina had been in the garden ever since she
got up, waiting for the postman—there was a little
gap in the trees where you could see him coming up
the road—and she and Roy had run to meet him
across the hay-field directly they spied him in the
distance. Running across the hay-field was forbidden
until after hay-making; but when a doll is
expected from Paris!…</p>

<p>Christina’s father was better than his word, for
it was the most beautiful doll ever made, with a
whole wardrobe of clothes, too.</p>

<p>Also a tiny tortoiseshell comb and a powder puff.
Also an extra pair of bronzed boots. Her eyes
opened and shut, and her eyebrows were real hair.
This is very unusual in a doll. “She shall be called
Joan Shoesmith,” said Christina, who had always
loved the name, it had been her first nurse’s.</p>

<p>Christina took Joan to her mother at once, Roy
running behind her with the box and the brown
paper and the string and the wardrobe, and Chrissie
calling back every minute, “Don’t drop the
powder puff whatever you do!” “Hold tight to
the hand-glass!” and things like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it’s splendid!” Mrs. Tiverton said. “There
isn’t a better doll in the world; only, Chrissie dear,
be very careful with it. I don’t know but that
father would have done better to have got something
stronger—this is so very fragile. I think,
perhaps you had better have it only indoors. Yes,
that’s the best way; after to-day you must play
with it only indoors.”</p>

<p>Thus Joan Shoesmith came to Mapleton.</p>

<p>How Christina loved her doll that first day! She
carried it everywhere and showed it everything—all
over the house, right into the attics; all over
the garden, right into the little black stove place
under the greenhouse; into the village, to introduce
her to the postmistress, who lived behind a brass
railing in the grocer’s shop; into the stables, to kiss
General Gordon, the old white horse. Jim, who
groomed the General, was the only person who did
not admire the doll properly, but how could you expect
a nice feeling from a boy who sets dogs on
rats?</p>

<p>It was two or three days after this that Roy
went down to the river to fish. He had to go alone,
because Christina wanted to play with Joan Shoesmith
in the nursery; but not more than half an
hour had passed when he heard footsteps in the
long grass behind him, and, looking up, there was
Christina. Now, as Christina had refused so bluntly
to have anything to do with his fishing, Roy was
surprised to see her, but more surprised still to see
that Joan Shoesmith had come too.</p>

<p>“Why, did mother say you might bring Joan?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said Christina, rather sulkily, “but I didn’t
think she’d mind.”</p>

<p>Roy looked troubled: his mother did not often
make rules to interfere with their play, and when
she did she liked to be obeyed. She had certainly
forbidden Christina to take Joan Shoesmith out of
the house. He did not say anything. Christina
sat down and began to play. She was not really
at all happy, because she knew it was wrong of her
to have disobeyed, and she was really a very good
girl. Roy went on fishing.</p>

<p>“Oh, do do something else,” Christina cried pettishly,
after a few minutes. “It’s so cold sitting
here waiting for you to catch stupid fish that never
come. Let’s go to the cave.” The cave was an old
disused lime-kiln, where robbers might easily have
lived.</p>

<p>“All right,” Roy said.</p>

<p>“I’ll get there first,” Christina called out, beginning
to run.</p>

<p>“Bah!” said Roy and ran after. They had raced
for a hundred yards, when, with a cry, Christina
fell. Roy, who was still some distance behind, having
had to pack up his rod, hastened to Christina’s
side. He found that she had scrambled to her
knees, and was looking anxiously into Joan Shoesmith’s
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Roy,” she wailed, “her eyes have gone!”</p>

<p>It was too true. Joan Shoesmith, lately so radiantly
observant, now turned to the world the
blankest of empty sockets. Roy took her poor
head in his hand and shook it. A melancholy rattle
told that a pair of once serviceable blue eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
now at large. Christina sank on the grass in an
agony of grief—due partly, also, to the knowledge
that if she had not been naughty this would never
have happened. Roy stood by, feeling hardly less
unhappy. After a while he took her arm. “Come
along,” he said, “let’s see if Jim can mend her.”</p>

<p>“Jim!” Christina cried in a fury, shaking off his
hand.</p>

<p>“But come along, anyway,” Roy said.</p>

<p>Christina continued sobbing. After a while she
moved to rise, but suddenly fell back again. Her
sobbing as suddenly ceased. “Roy!” she exclaimed
fearfully, “I can’t walk.”</p>

<p>Christina had sprained her ankle.</p>

<p>Roy ran to the house as fast as he could to find
help, and very soon old Stedder, the gardener, and
Jim were carrying Christina between them, with
mother and nurse walking by her side. Christina
was put to bed at once and her foot wrapped in
bandages, but she cried almost incessantly, no matter
how often she was assured that she was forgiven.
“Her sobs,” the cook said, coming downstairs after
her twentieth visit to the nursery, “her sobs are that
heart-rending I couldn’t stand it; and all the while
she asks for that blessed doll, which its eyes is rattling
in its head like marbles through falling on
the ground, and Master Roy and Jim’s trying to
catch them with a skewer.”</p>

<p>Cook was quite right. Roy and Jim, with Joan
Shoesmith between them, were seated in the harness-room,
probing tenderly the depths of that
luckless creature’s skull. A housemaid was looking
on without enthusiasm. “You won’t do it,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
she said every now and then; “you can’t mend dolls’
eyes with skewers. No one can. It’s impossible.
The king himself couldn’t. You ought to take it to
the Miss Bannisters’ brother at Dormstaple. He’d
mend it in a jiffy—there’s nothing he can’t do in
that way.”</p>

<p>Roy at last gave up in despair. “I’ll take it to
the Miss Bannisters’ brother,” he said, rising with
Joan Shoesmith in his arms; “it’s only six miles.”
But a sudden swoop from a figure in the doorway
interrupted his bold plan.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” cried nurse,
seizing the doll, “with that angel upstairs crying
for it every minute, and the doctor saying she’s in
a high fever with lying on the wet grass”; and with
a swirl of white skirts and apron, nurse and Joan
Shoesmith were gone.</p>

<p>Roy put his hands in his pockets and wandered
moodily into the garden. The world seemed to
have no sun in it any more.</p>

<p>The next day Christina was really ill. It was
not only the ankle, but she had caught a chill, the
doctor said, and they must be very careful with her.
Roy went about with a sad and sadder face, for
Christina was his only playmate, and he loved her
more than anything else; and, also, it seemed so
silly not to be able to mend a doll’s eyes. He moped
in and out of the house all the morning, and was
continually being sent away from Christina’s door,
because she was too ill to bear anyone in the room
except nurse. She was wandering in her mind,
nurse said, and kept on saying that she had blinded
her doll, and crying to have its eyes made right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
again; but she would not let a hand be laid upon
her, so that to have Joan Shoesmith mended seemed
impossible. Nurse cried too as she said it, and Roy
joined with her. He could not remember ever having
been so miserable.</p>

<p>The doctor looked very grave when he was going
away. “That doll ought to be put right,” he said
to Mrs. Tiverton. “She’s a sensitive little thing,
evidently, and this feeling of disobeying you and
treating her father’s present lightly is doing her a
lot of harm, apart altogether from the chill and the
sprain. If we could get those eyes in again she’d
be better in no time, I believe.”</p>

<p>Roy and his mother heard this with a sinking
heart, for they knew that Christina’s arms locked
Joan Shoesmith to her side almost as if they were
bars of iron.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” the doctor said, “I’ve left some medicine
that ought to give her some sleep, and I shall
come again this afternoon.” So saying, the doctor
touched up his horse, and Mrs. Tiverton walked
into the house again.</p>

<p>Roy stood still pondering.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mind was made up, and he set off
for the high road at a good swinging pace. At the
gate he passed Jim. “If they want to know where
I am,” he called, “say I’ve gone to the Miss Bannisters’
brother.”</p>

<p>Miss Sarah Bannister and Miss Selina Bannister
had lived in Dormstaple as long almost as anyone
could remember, although they were by no means
old. They had the red house with white windows,
the kind of house which one can see only in old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
English market towns. There was a gravel drive
before it, in the shape of a banana, the carriages
going in at one end and out at the other, stopping
at the front door steps in the middle. The blinds
were of that kind through which no one who is outside
can see anything, and all who are inside can see
everything. The door knocker was of the brightest
brass. Behind the house was a very large garden,
with a cedar in the midst; and a very soft lawn on
which hundreds of birds used to settle every morning
in winter for the breakfast that the Miss Bannisters
provided. The cedar and the other trees had
cigar boxes nailed to them, for tits or wrens to build
in, and half cocoa-nuts and lumps of fat were always
hung just outside the windows. At one side
of the house was the stable and coach-house, on the
other side a billiard-room, now used as a workshop.
And his workshop brings us to the Miss Bannisters’
brother.</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ brother was an invalid, and
he was also what is called an eccentric. “Eccentric,
that’s what he is,” Mr. Stallabrass, who kept the
King’s Arms, had said, and there could be no doubt
of it after that. This meant that he wore rather
shabby clothes, and took no interest in the town, and
was rarely seen outside the house or the garden.</p>

<p>Rumor said, however, that he was very clever
with his hands, and could make anything. What
was the matter with the Miss Bannisters’ brother no
one seemed to know, but it gradually kept him more
and more indoors.</p>

<p>No one ever spoke of him as Mr. Bannister, they
always said the Miss Bannisters’ brother. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
could see the Miss Bannisters, especially Miss
Selina, you would understand this; but although
they had deep, gruff voices they were really very
kind.</p>

<p>As time went on, and the Miss Bannisters’
brother did not seem to grow any better, or to be
likely to take up his gardening again, the Miss
Bannisters had racked their brains to think of some
employment for him other than reading, which is
not good for anyone all day long. One evening,
some years before this story, while the three were
at tea, Miss Selina cried suddenly, “I have it!”—so
suddenly, indeed, that Miss Sarah spilt her cup,
and her brother took three lumps of sugar instead
of two.</p>

<p>“Have what?” they both exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “I was talking to-day with
Mrs. Boniface, and she was saying how nice it
would be if there were someone in the town who
could mend toys—poor Miss Piper at the Bazaar
being so useless, and all the carpenters understanding
nothing but making book-shelves and cucumber
frames, and London being so far away, and I said
‘Yes,’ never thinking of Theodore here. And, of
course, it’s the very thing for him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Miss Sarah. “He could take
the old billiard-room.”</p>

<p>“And have a stove put in it,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“And put up a bench,” said Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“And some cocoa-nut matting on the floor,” said
Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“Linoleum,” said Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“Cocoa-nut matting,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we could call it the Dolls’ Hospital,” said
Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“Infirmary,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“I prefer Hospital,” said Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“Infirmary,” said Miss Selina. “Dr. Bannister,
house surgeon, attends daily from ten till one.”</p>

<p>“It would be the prettiest and kindliest occupation,”
said Miss Sarah, “as well as a useful
one.”</p>

<p>“That’s the whole point of it,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p>And that is how—five or six years ago—the Miss
Bannisters’ brother came to open the Dolls’ Infirmary.
But he did not stop short at mending
dolls. He mended all kinds of other things too;
he advised on the length of tails for kites; he built
ships; he had even made fireworks.</p>

<p>Roy walked into Dormstaple at about one
o’clock, very tired and hot and dusty and hungry;
and a little later, after asking his way more than
once, he stood on the doorstep of the Miss Bannisters’
house. The door was opened by old Mary,
and as the flavor of roast fowl rushed out, Roy
knew how hungry he was. “I want to see the Miss
Bannisters’ brother,” he said, “please.”</p>

<p>“You’re too late,” was the answer. “Come to-morrow
morning. Mr. Theodore never sees children
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must,” Roy almost sobbed.</p>

<p>“Chut, chut!” said old Mary, “little boys
shouldn’t say must.”</p>

<p>“But when they must, what else is there for them
to say?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“Chut, chut!” said old Mary again. “That’s imperent!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Now run away, and come to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Roy. He covered his face
with his hands, and really and truly cried—a thing
he would scorn to do on his own account.</p>

<p>While he stood there in this distress a hand was
placed on his arm, and he was drawn gently into
the house. He heard the door shut behind him.
The hand then guided him along passages into a
great room, and there he was liberated. Roy looked
round; it was the most fascinating room he had ever
seen. There was a long bench at the window with a
comfortable chair before it, and on the bench were
hammers and chisels and all kinds of tools. A ship
nearly finished lay in one place, a clockwork steamer
in another, a pair of rails wound about the floor on
the cocoa-nut matting—in and out like a snake—on
which a toy train probably ran, and here and there
were signals. On the shelves were colored papers,
bottles, boxes, and wire. In one corner was a huge
kite, as high as a man, with a great face painted on
it. Several dolls, more or less broken, lay on the
table.</p>

<p>All this he saw in a moment. Then he looked
at the owner of the hand, who had been standing
beside him all the while with an amused expression
on his delicate, kind face. Roy knew in an instant
it was the Miss Bannisters’ brother.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Miss Bannisters’ brother, “so
when one must, one must?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Roy said, half timidly.</p>

<p>“Quite right too,” said the Miss Bannisters’
brother. “‘Must’ is a very good word, if one has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the character to back it up. And now tell me,
quickly, what is the trouble. Something very
small, I should think, or you wouldn’t be able to
carry it in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“It’s not in my pocket,” Roy said, “it’s not here
at all. I want—I want a lesson.”</p>

<p>“A lesson?” Mr. Theodore asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, in eye mending. When eyes fall inside
and rattle, you know.”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ brother sat down and took
Roy between his knees. There was something
about this little dusty, nervous boy that his clients
(often tearful enough) had never displayed before,
and he wished to understand it. “Now tell me all
about it,” he said.</p>

<p>Roy told him everything, right from the first.</p>

<p>“And what is your father’s name?” was the only
question that had to be asked. When he heard this,
the Miss Bannisters’ brother rose. “You must stay
here a minute,” he said.</p>

<p>“But—but the lesson?” Roy exclaimed. “You
know I ought to be getting back again. Christina—”</p>

<p>“All right, just a minute,” Mr. Theodore replied.</p>

<p>When the Miss Bannisters’ brother came back,
Miss Selina came with him. “Come and get tidy
for dinner,” she said, “and afterwards we’ll drive
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I can’t stop for dinner!” Roy cried.
“It’s much too important to stop for dinner; I’m
not really hungry either.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Dinner will only take a little while,” said Miss
Selina, “and the horse can be getting ready at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
same time; and if you were to walk you wouldn’t
be home nearly so soon as you will if you drive,
dinner time included.”</p>

<p>“But the lesson—?” Roy gasped again.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve thought of a better way than the lesson,”
Miss Selina said. “Mr. Bannister is going
with you.”</p>

<p>It took a moment for Roy to appreciate this, but
when he did he was the happiest boy in Dormstaple.</p>

<p>He never tasted a nicer chicken, he said afterwards.</p>

<p>Certainly not more than three-quarters of an
hour had passed before the carriage was on its way
to Mapleton—with the Miss Bannisters’ brother
propped up with cushions (for he could not bear
the jolting of carriages) on the back seat, and Miss
Selina and Miss Sarah, who had come to look after
their brother, on the other. Roy was on the box.
You never saw such puzzled faces as the Dormstaple
people had when the party went by, for Mr.
Theodore had not driven out these twenty years;
but their surprise was nothing to that of old Mary,
who wandered about the rooms all the rest of the
day muttering, “Little imperent boy!”</p>

<p>At the Mapleton gates Roy jumped down and
rushed up to the house. His mother came to the
door as he reached it. “Oh, mother, mother,” he
cried, “he’s come himself!”</p>

<p>“Who has come?” she asked, forgetting to say
anything about Roy’s long absence. “I hoped it
was the doctor. Christina is worse, I’m afraid; she
won’t sleep.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Roy assured her. “I’ve brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Miss Bannisters’ brother, who mends dolls and
everything, and he’ll put the eyes right in no time,
and then Chrissie’ll be well again. Here they are!”</p>

<p>At this moment the carriage reached the door;
but Mrs. Tiverton’s perplexities were not removed
by it. On the contrary, they were increased, for she
saw before her three total strangers. Miss Selina,
however, hastily stepped out and took Mrs. Tiverton’s
hand and explained the whole story, adding,
“We are not coming in; my sister and I have a call
to pay a little further on. We shall come back in
less than an hour for our brother, carry him off, and
be no trouble at all. I know how little you must
want even people that you know just now.” In
spite of Mrs. Tiverton’s protest, Miss Selina had
her way, and the sisters drove off.</p>

<p>While this conversation had been in progress,
Roy had been speaking to the Miss Bannisters’
brother. He had been preparing the speech ever
since they had started, for it was very important.
“Please,” he said, “please how much will this visit
be, because I want to pay for it myself?”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ brother smiled. “But suppose
you haven’t enough,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I think I have,” Roy told him. “I’ve
got seven-and-six, and when the vet. came to see
General Gordon it was only five shillings.”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ brother smiled again. “Our
infirmary is rather peculiar,” he said. “We don’t
take money at all; we take promises; different kinds
of promises from different people, according to
their means. We ask rich parents’ friends to promise
to give away old toys or story-books, or scrap-books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
or something of that kind, to real hospitals—children’s
hospitals. We find that much better than
money. Money’s such a nuisance. One is always
losing the key to the money-box.”</p>

<p>Roy was a little disappointed. “Oh, yes,” he
said, however, “I’ll do that. Won’t I just? But,
you know,” he added, “you can always break open
a money-box if it comes to the worst. Pokers
aren’t bad.”</p>

<p>It was just then that the Miss Bannisters drove
off, and Mrs. Tiverton asked their brother to come
to Christina’s room with her. Roy would have given
anything to have been allowed upstairs; but as it
was forbidden he went to see Jim and tell him the
news.</p>

<p>Christina was moaning in the bed with Joan
Shoesmith in her arms as the Miss Bannisters’
brother sat down beside her. “Come,” he said
gently, “let me feel your pulse.”</p>

<p>Christina pushed her wrist towards him wearily·</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not yours,” he said, with a little laugh.
“I mean your little lady’s. I’m not your doctor.
I’m a doll’s doctor.”</p>

<p>Christina turned her poor flushed face towards
him for the first time. A doll’s doctor—it was a
new idea. And he really seemed to be all right—not
anyone dressed up to make her feel foolish or
coax her into taking horrid medicine. “Was it
your carriage I heard?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I have come on purpose. But
so many dolls are ill just now that I must be getting
away soon. It’s quite a bad time for dolls, especially—oddly
enough—French ones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mine is French,” Christina said, growing really
interested.</p>

<p>“Ah, how very curious!” he answered. “And
now for the pulse,” and he drew out a large gold
watch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiverton was looking on with tears in her
eyes. Christina had not taken this quiet interest
in anything or kept so still in bed for many hours.
Not even the sleeping draught had had any effect.</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ brother held Joan Shoesmith’s
tiny wrist and looked very grave. “Dear,
dear!” he said, “I ought to have been sent for before,
and then I could have cured her here in your
arms. As it is, I must take her to the light. Won’t
you have that nice jelly while I am treating Miss ——?
Let me see, what was the name?”</p>

<p>“Joan,” Christina said: “Joan Shoesmith.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—Miss Shoesmith. By the time you
have finished the jelly I ought to have finished my
visit.” So saying he rose and carried Joan Shoesmith
to the window seat behind the curtains, while
Mrs. Tiverton gave Christina the jelly. Christina
took it, nurse said afterwards, like a lamb—though
I never saw a lamb take jelly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Miss Bannisters’ brother had
taken some tools and a tube of seccotine from his
pocket, and he had lifted up Joan Shoesmith’s hair,
cut a hole in her head, and was busily readjusting
the machinery of her eyes. It was all done in five
minutes, just as Christina was eating the last
mouthful. “There,” he said, returning to the bedside,
“that’s all right. I think our patient can see
now as well as ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Christina peered into Joan Shoesmith’s face with
a cry of joy, and sank back on the pillow in an
ecstasy of content.</p>

<p>Neither Mrs. Tiverton nor the Miss Bannisters’
brother dared to move for some minutes. While
they sat there the doctor tiptoed in. He crossed to
the bed and looked at Christina. “She’s asleep,” he
said. “Splendid! She’s all right now. It was
sleep she wanted more than anything. Don’t let
her hear a sound, nurse, for hours.”</p>

<p>They found Roy waiting for the news. When
he heard it he jumped for joy. His mother caught
him up and hugged him. “You thoughtful little
imp,” she cried—and, turning to the doctor, told
him the story. He went off, laughing. “I shall
take my door-plate down when I get home,” he
called out as he drove off, “and send it round to
you, Bannister. You’re the real doctor.”</p>

<p>When the Miss Bannisters drove back they found
tea all ready, and Mrs. Tiverton would not hear of
their leaving without it. And when they did leave,
an hour later, they were all fast friends.</p>

<p>Roy and Christina never think of going to Dormstaple
now without calling at the red house.</p>

<h2 id="THE_IDEA_THAT_WENT_ASTRAY">THE IDEA THAT WENT ASTRAY</h2>

<p class="author">By Pauline Carrington Bouvé</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was Danny’s idea. Danny always had a great
many ideas, and sometimes they were good,
sometimes they were not, as is apt to be the case
with people who have a great many of anything—especially
ideas.</p>

<p>“It will be such fun!” said Amy.</p>

<p>“And something new,” agreed Janie.</p>

<p>“Who’ll cut the face?” asked Fred, who always
wanted to know how things were going to be done.</p>

<p>“Can’t you, Milly?” asked all the children at
once. “Can’t you?” and they all gathered round a
little girl who was dressing a doll in an automobile
suit.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” she asked.
“What kind of a face, and what for?” She was
fastening the odd lenses from two pairs of Aunt
Mildred’s spectacles into a wire frame for goggles
for the doll.</p>

<p>“Why, a pumpkin face, to scare Uncle Ned! He
always laughs at us if we are afraid of anything.”</p>

<p>“If you will get the pumpkin—a nice large one—and
will lend me your new jack-knife, why, I’ll
see what I can do,” she said.</p>

<p>Fred promised, and the rest of that day and the
next the children spent in preparation for Hallowe’en.
Uncle Ned was a young lawyer in Boston,
but he came home Saturday nights to spend
Sundays with Aunt Mildred, and Hallowe’en happened
to come on Saturday, which just suited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Milly succeeded in making a very ugly face
making enormous eyes and a monstrous mouth, in
which she managed to fasten two rows of corn
grains for teeth. Then, when the rest of the children
were out playing, she took her pumpkin head
up into the attic, and hunted for other things to
complete its make-up. In an old trunk she found
a heavy wig, and this she fastened firmly on the
head with some glue. When at last she showed it,
with its great shock of black hair, everybody agreed
that it was ugly enough to frighten anybody.</p>

<p>“He’ll think it’s a goblin,” said Milly, who had
read a great many fairy-stories.</p>

<p>“There aren’t any goblins,” said Fred, who was
always practical.</p>

<p>In the evening, soon after supper, they all went
out and stuck it up on the end of a stray bean-pole,
which they leaned up against the post of the garden
gate. Dave Peters gave them a candle, which they
lighted and thrust inside of the hollow head.</p>

<p>“Ugh, how ugly!” they said, and then went in
the house to wait.</p>

<p>After a while Fred proposed going out to see
how it looked again, and every one of the children
followed him. What if the candle should have
burned out or been blown out?</p>

<p>Fred gave a low whistle and stopped before he
reached the gate, and all the children called,
“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>There the ugly thing hung, the light shining
through the big empty eyes and grinning corn
teeth, and just behind there was certainly a great
white something that looked like wings!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that white thing?” said Milly, in a
frightened whisper, as she clutched Fred’s arm.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back!” begged Amy and Janie.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of,” said Fred,
boldly; but he did not move a step nearer to the
gate. “You are always so ’fraid of things!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go see what it is! I’m scared, scared!”
wailed Milly, who scarcely recognized her own
handiwork in the darkness, so strange it looked.</p>

<p>In the excitement they did not hear the car
whistle nor the sound of footsteps on the gravel
walk.</p>

<p>Just then a breeze sprang up, flaring the candle,
which sent out a long tongue of flame from the
pumpkin head’s mouth, and the white something
behind began to wave. Like a flock of frightened
birds the children, Fred, Amy, Janie and Milly,
turned and ran as fast as they could, stumbling
over each other in their flight.</p>

<p>A man’s figure darkened the doorway. “Hello!”
said Uncle Ned. “What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the pumpkin—there’s something there behind
it—we thought we’d scare you!”</p>

<p>They were all talking together, so Uncle Ned
did not understand at first.</p>

<p>“And you scared yourselves?” he said, at last.
“Come, let us see what the ‘something white’ is,”
and he went straight up to the garden fence and
pulled down Aunt Mildred’s white crocheted
shawl.</p>

<p>“Milly forgot to take it in, as I asked her,”
remarked Aunt Mildred, “and it’s lucky you
found it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Ned laughed so loud that everybody else
laughed, too.</p>

<p>Then he put his hand down into his overcoat
pocket and brought forth two big brown parcels
of nuts and candy, and Aunt Mildred brought in
a basket of big red apples, and after all, it was a
jolly Hallowe’en, although, as Milly remarked,
the “getting scared part got mixed up.”</p>

<h2 id="GRAVITY_GREGG">GRAVITY GREGG</h2>

<p class="author">By Isaac Ogden Rankin</p>

<p class="dropcap">John Paul Gregg had a hobby. Nobody
could doubt it who was with him, even though
he did not happen to hear one of the other boys call
him “Specific Gravity,” or “Fic,” for short.
Gravity Gregg it was and continued to be until it
got into the newspapers, and now it is probably
settled upon him for life.</p>

<p>When he was a baby he was always investigating
the why and the wherefore and more particularly
the how of everything he could get his chubby
hands on. If he saw anything moving, especially,
he always wanted to know why it moved—a curiosity
which cost him a finger before he was ten
years old.</p>

<p>He was a pretty good all-round student, but it
was in the natural philosophy class that he shone.
He had picked up somewhere an old copy of a
standard book on physics, and his use of the information
he had gathered from it caused terror to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
good lady who had charge of the department in the
village school.</p>

<p>He was apt, for instance, to complicate her mild
and innocent experiments by suggesting new applications
of the principle involved; and the amount of
broken apparatus which went down to his account
in the laboratory where the boys were sometimes allowed
to work made his mother sigh.</p>

<p>His devotion to physics seemed very unpractical
to quiet Mrs. Gregg, who had set her heart on making
a minister of her eldest son. She had named
him John Paul, by way of having the names of two
apostles ready for the future, and she had day-dreams
of sitting in the front pew in church to hear
him preach, while she looked up to him with wondering
delight.</p>

<p>It was a trial to be thinking of the Rev. John
Paul Gregg, a tall, dignified and grave man, who
was respected by everybody and had, perhaps, published
a book of sermons, and then to have a
freckled lad, round-faced and brown as a berry,
with a scar across his forehead where an exploding
crucible had just missed the eye, burst in upon her
to beg her best preserving-kettle for an experiment.
And to hear the future clergyman called “Fic”
Gregg all over her end of the town made her
shudder.</p>

<p>Most of the people of Lavenham who knew him
thought Specific Gravity mildly insane, but they
all liked him. He was so simple and sincere and
kind that they could not help it; but they never
knew what he would be up to next in the line of
dangerous experiment. He was as inventive as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fox, as spry as a cat, and as steady-headed as a
monkey.</p>

<p>Old Deacon Podgers looked out at his window
one morning when it was blowing half a gale, and
on the top of the unfinished steeple of the new Baptist
Church saw a strange black object. The deacon,
who had been a sea-captain all his active days,
turned to the wall for his spy glass, and recognized
Gravity Gregg, who had climbed up there to study
the vibration of materials, as he told the deacon
when he asked him why he risked his life so
recklessly.</p>

<p>John Paul acquired his name of Specific Gravity
from an early answer in the philosophy class, but
it did not become publicly his until one day after
an anxious night in the big railroad freight-yards
just outside the town.</p>

<p>The Gregg house was on the brow of the hill
overlooking the river and the flats where the railroad
runs, and Fic knew every landmark visible
from his window.</p>

<p>It was a holiday. He had been fishing all day
and went to bed early, but woke up about midnight
with a start to see a flickering light reflected on the
wall. He was at the window in a moment, and after
taking an observation said to himself, “That’s in
the freight-yards! It must be a car on fire!”</p>

<p>It was not a big blaze, like a burning house, but
a flickering little blaze, like that of the lamps on
the fruit-peddlers’ stands at night.</p>

<p>The desire to investigate was strong upon John
Paul. His mother had never objected to his going
to fires, but would she let him go so late at night?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
He would not wake her up to ask, and with a sigh
went back to bed again and dropped off to sleep—only
to be wakened up by the distant sound of a fire-engine
rattling through the streets and to see the
same flickering light at the same spot on the wall.</p>

<p>He went to the window again and took the field-glass,
which was one of his most cherished possessions.</p>

<p>“It’s a car, sure enough, and they’ve got the
engines out,” he said. “I wish I could go and see.”</p>

<p>He went back to bed, but tossed and tossed,
while the light still flickered on the wall.</p>

<p>“It’s strange they don’t put it out,” he thought.
“They must have been at work at it two or three
hours.”</p>

<p>He rose again and went to the window, but the
air was so cold that he dressed himself, his curiosity
all the while growing stronger. Taking his shoes
in his hand he went softly down to the door, took
the spare latch-key from its hook, let himself quietly
out, put on his shoes, and slipped down to the
front gate.</p>

<p>It was a windy night, with the moon eating up
the clouds, and the streets were very quiet. The
first sign of excitement was at the gate of the yards,
where another fire-engine was just going in.</p>

<p>Fic slipped in beside it and took a short cut across
the tracks, between and under the cars, to the other
side next the big freight-house, where a fire-engine
was pumping water through long lines of black hose
on a big tank-car that was all in a blaze on the under
side.</p>

<p>The tracks were flooded. Fic balanced himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
on a rail and watched the blazing car with a puzzled
look. Every time the stream of water fairly struck
the center of the flame it flew in every direction
in sheets and threads of fire, but always settled
back at the bottom of the car.</p>

<p>The division superintendent of the road drove
up. Fic knew him by sight, for he lived in Lavenham
and went to his church.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” the superintendent said,
in a high-keyed voice. “Why don’t you put out the
fire?”</p>

<p>Three men drew out of the group around the
fire-engine and came to the side of the buggy. One
was the yardmaster, another the conductor in charge
of the train, and the third the fire-chief.</p>

<p>“It’s naphtha,” said the chief. “There’s a leak
somewhere in the pipes that lets it down to the fire
a little at a time. We can’t get at it for the heat,
and the water only scatters it.”</p>

<p>“The stuff must be pretty well out by this time,”
said the conductor; “and when it gets low and the
fire works up into the tank there will be an explosion.
It’s awful stuff for fire.”</p>

<p>Fic was standing by the front wheel of the buggy
and saw the superintendent’s face grow pale by the
flickering light.</p>

<p>“Can’t you move the car?”</p>

<p>“We can’t get near enough to couple, and the
truck is about burned through. We moved the
other cars, but we can’t move the buildings.”</p>

<p>“Why not bring up the gravel-train from the
lower switch and fill up from below until the fire
is buried.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“There won’t be time. The tank’s nearly empty
now. It’s been burning all night.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” answered the chief.
“Those tanks hold a lot, and it doesn’t take much
naphtha to make a big blaze. What I’m afraid
of is that it will explode while it is half full, and
scatter the burning stuff all over the yard. Or else
it will burn a week, and stop all the work in the
yards while we are waiting for it to burst! That
will never do.”</p>

<p>Fic had been doing a lot of thinking while this
hasty consultation went on. He had not studied
his physics for nothing, and he was sure he had the
key to the problem.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Sanderson, may I speak?”</p>

<p>The four men looked down and saw a boy in a
short jacket, with eyes that were burning with excitement,
and Mr. Sanderson said, in amazement:
“Hello! Who are you, and what are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” said Fic, drawing himself up
to the dashboard in his excitement, “I know how to
put out the fire!”</p>

<p>“You do, do you! Well, speak up quick! It’ll
be worth a good many thousand dollars and perhaps
a few lives, if you do.”</p>

<p>“Take off the lid of the tank on top and pour
water into the tank. The wind blows the fire to
one side, and if you can once get a hose in you will
do it.”</p>

<p>“How will that put the fire out?” cried the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“It’s the specific gravity. Water is denser than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
naphtha and will sink to the bottom. If it doesn’t
explode when you open it, it won’t afterward. The
water will sink to the bottom and get into the leaky
pipes.”</p>

<p>“I believe the lad’s right,” said the fire-chief.
“At all events, we’ll try it. Who’ll help?”</p>

<p>Two or three volunteers came forward and lifted
a ladder on the windward side of the car. The
chief mounted and pried up the lid. No explosion
followed, and on thrusting in his hand he found
that the naphtha was still very near the top. If the
fire should reach and scatter it there would be no
hope of saving the buildings, he knew, and even
the vapor was dangerous. He called for a hose,
thrust it in at the vent, and pulled down the lid to
keep the vapor in. Then he climbed down to watch
the result.</p>

<p>Already, as he reached the ground and turned
to look, the flame had diminished. In five minutes
the fire was out, and water was dripping from the
cooled end of the leaky pipe, which was soon tied
up and made safe. Not only was the danger over,
but almost the whole contents of the tank were
saved.</p>

<p>No sooner was the work of repair over by the
gleam of hastily lighted lanterns than the superintendent,
like a man relieved by miracle, suddenly
pulled himself up from the side of the disabled car
and looked about him.</p>

<p>Then he shouted, “Where’s that boy?”</p>

<p>Nobody knew. For the moment they had forgotten
all about the boy in thinking of the escape
from peril; and as for John Paul, so soon as he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that the fire was out and his faith in the principle
of specific gravity vindicated, his interest had
ceased, and he had turned across the flooded tracks
toward home.</p>

<p>He slipped quietly in, got to bed by half past
four without disturbing anybody, and was up as
usual when his mother called him to help her with
the morning work. He never troubled her with his
experiments, and it did not occur to him to speak
of the night’s adventure.</p>

<p>Even the reporter of the <cite>Daily Flashlight</cite> was
too much interested in the success of the experiment
to interview the boy, although he made the best of
him in his story in the morning paper. He was a
stranger in Lavenham, and had never heard of the
uncanny doings of Gravity Gregg. It was not until
the next day that the whole story got out, and
Fic found it necessary to go to school by the back
streets to avoid public notice.</p>

<p>When the division superintendent reached home
in the early morning, he found his wife waiting for
him with a cup of hot coffee, and as he drank it he
told her the story.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall have to advertise for the boy,”
he said. “I can’t let him go. He saved the car and
the buildings, and perhaps the lives of some of
us.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t do that,” answered Mrs. Sanderson,
who knew nothing about physics but had
caught two words in the story. “He lives right
around the corner in the little brown house. He’s
the oldest son of the Widow Gregg, and nearly
blew our Ralph’s head off one day last week with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
one of his experiments. All the boys call him
Gravity Gregg.”</p>

<p>While Mrs. Gregg was at breakfast the door-bell
rang, and Mr. Sanderson invited himself in. It
took a long while to tell the story, for Mrs. Gregg
couldn’t understand that John Paul had been anywhere
but safe in bed all night, and John Paul
couldn’t see that there was anything to make a fuss
about in so simple an expedient in practical physics.</p>

<p>People said that the railroad ought to make the
boy a handsome present, but it did not. What it
did do was to see that he got the best kind of an
education and then to put him where he could climb
high in their employ.</p>

<p>He carries a watch which Mr. Sanderson and the
fire-chief gave him as soon as he was considered by
them old enough to take care of it, on the case of
which is engraved a name and a date. His mother
is proud of him, and, luckily for her pet ambition,
she is quite as proud of another son who is just such
a minister as she hoped to make of John Paul
Gregg.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was a half-holiday at the quarries; the schools,
the stores and shops all closed at noon. The
whole quarry town had turned out to see the great
granite shaft hauled to the station.</p>

<p>To avoid the risk and cost of two loadings, the
forty-ton stone had been derricked to the road at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the edge of the quarry, and there, under a temporary
shed, had been cut, polished and crated. It now
lay blocked upon a low, powerful dray, ready to be
moved to the freight siding in the village, over a
mile distant.</p>

<p>The stone was the largest single block of granite
ever quarried at the Laston ledges. It had been an
expensive job from the start, and a very troublesome
one. It had led to a strike, a riot, and almost
to murder.</p>

<p>There had been no man among the two hundred
in the quarries capable of properly dressing the
stone. So the company had brought in Gunar Gustavesen
to do the work. And the men were angry
at the intrusion of the outsider.</p>

<p>The company was warned. So was Gustavesen.
But the work on the shaft went on—until the strike.
Jonnasen, the leader of the men, was as sure he was
right and as stubborn as Hendricks, president of
the firm. Then the men grew ugly, there was a riot,
Gustavesen’s furniture was burned in the street, and
he himself so brutally attacked that he still lay
slowly mending in one of the company’s houses.</p>

<p>It was a bitter victory, and Jonnasen was too honest
a man to like it. When it was reported to him
that Havelok Gustavesen, the sixteen-year-old son
of the non-union man, had found some menial work
in the company’s stables, he made it clear to the men
that the boy was to be let alone. That is how it
happened that young Gustavesen appeared among
the men who were busy with the twenty-four-horse
team attached to the heavy dray.</p>

<p>The road from the quarry to the station was down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
grade except for two steep hills, where the ledges
cropped out, and where every ounce of the pulling
power of the great team would be required. At the
top of the second rise the downward slope stretched
away for about half a mile with a sharp curve round
the edge of the old quarry. The curve was guarded
by heavy stone posts and a wooden rail.</p>

<p>The possibilities of all this had been reckoned
with, and in order to keep the forty tons of granite
from pushing the horses before it, a pair of heavy
steel shoes had been fitted to a brake that might
have held a freight-train.</p>

<p>Jonnasen settled himself upon the seat of the
dray, gathered up the reins of the pole-team, and,
with his foot upon the brake, gave the word to start.
The drivers of the forward spans echoed the command,
and the dray rolled out upon the road.</p>

<p>There is something inspiring in the work of willing
horses. It is a noble enthusiasm, little less than
inspiration, that takes possession of the horses themselves.
The crowd along the road felt it and cheered,
as the twelve pairs, pulling like one, took the great
polished shaft to the top of the first hill.</p>

<p>It was a short and gentle descent to the second
and steepest ridge. Jonnasen put on the brake, and
caught the weight so easily that the horses of the
pole moved free in their traces, yet kept them fairly
taut.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the slope he started them
forward on the trot, loosed the brake, and sent the
long line at a good pace to take the second ridge.</p>

<p>It was a pretty piece of work. So beautifully
did the immense stone mount the rise that even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
members of the firm in attendance cheered with
the rest.</p>

<p>Then a silence fell. No one spoke of danger, but
as the great, shining shaft pointed down the slope,
its forty tons of dead weight seemed suddenly to
have changed into active power. It seemed to poise
at the top of the hill. It was a thing alive.</p>

<p>The ridge was a narrow ledge of granite, hardly
wide enough to stop the dray upon. Jonnasen had
intended to breathe his team here, but by the time
the dray was up, the lead horses were already going
down, and the load, without a pause, began to descend.</p>

<p>Jonnasen bore down on the brake, drew in his
horses, and looked off down the long grade to the
turn about the precipitous edge of the old quarry.</p>

<p>He drew a short, hard breath. No cooler man
than this tall Swede ever held a rein. He could
handle horses as he could handle men.</p>

<p>But he had made a mistake, and he knew it instantly.
He should have stopped on the ridge, as
he intended. He should have unhooked all the
horses ahead of the pole-team here. They were in
the way. The horses at the pole could guide the
load down. The others were a menace, if anything
should happen.</p>

<p>“But nothing should happen!” he muttered to
himself, and a half-smile broke over his rugged face
as he heard the grind of the brake and saw the slack
in the traces taken up. The load was under his
foot.</p>

<p>Just then the lead horses broke into a trot. Immediately
the whole line started. Jonnasen bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
down on the brake, and drew his own team hard
back to check the pull, when there was a sharp
crack, like the report of a pistol, and one of the
steel shoes fell broken to the road.</p>

<p>Instantly a dozen warning voices told him what
he too well knew had happened. The big horses
knew, too, and settled back to stop the push from
behind. Jonnasen put all his weight into the single
steel shoe that bit at the back wheel. A stream of
sparks flew from the tire, and a wild, shrill scream
told that the brake still worked. But the horses
were sliding.</p>

<p>Then the pole ran into the team ahead, the horses
plunged, and there was confusion.</p>

<p>“Unhook them from the pole!” Jonnasen called
to the nearest driver. The man dropped his lines,
caught the jangling traces and tried to run in between
the teams, but was struck by a hoof and
rolled out of the road.</p>

<p>Panic seized the whole line of frightened horses.
Some of the drivers still held their teams back, but
they were being dragged helplessly.</p>

<p>“Unhook them!” Jonnasen shouted to the crowd
shrinking back against the fence. Were he free
to let his own team go, they might keep ahead of
the load, and take the turn with a possible chance
of rounding the edge of the deep quarry.</p>

<p>“Unhook them!” he shouted again, powerless to
quit his place and do the thing himself. But no one
was able to move.</p>

<p>Then a lithe young figure came bounding down
from the ridge. It was young Gustavesen. He
sprang upon the dray, ran forward, seized the whip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in Jonnasen’s hand, and in a cool, deliberate voice,
said:</p>

<p>“When I get hold, let ’em jump quick.” He
dropped between the horses to the pole, and clutching
the harness, got quickly out to the end. He was
bending to catch the evener when a forward wheel
struck a rut, and the long tongue snapped him
viciously into the air.</p>

<p>He caught the hames of the nigh horse, and saved
himself. Hanging to the hames, he swung back, lay
out along the tongue, and reached again for the
evener.</p>

<p>Jonnasen was watching, and as the boy laid his
hand upon the big hook, he loosed the reins, the
horses lunged, and the long, heavy bar was unhooked
almost of itself.</p>

<p>Like a flash the boy straightened and swung the
lash about the horses ahead, throwing himself an
instant later upon the back of the horse he was
holding.</p>

<p>The loosened teams were barely dragged to the
side as the pole-team went by on the gallop, with
its forty-ton stone.</p>

<p>Jonnasen had the horses under perfect control.
He could guide them straight ahead. But the
mighty stone was gathering momentum with every
leap of the team, and powerful as they were Jonnasen
began to realize that they would never be
able to check or turn the downward plunge at the
curve on the edge of the quarry.</p>

<p>Then he saw that young Gustavesen was making
no attempt to fling himself from the galloping
horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jump!” he shouted. “Jump, quick!”</p>

<p>Havelok turned. “I can’t jump!” he called back.
“My leg! Tend your team! I’m safe here!”</p>

<p>The absolute confidence of the boy sent a strange
thrill through the big Swede. It steadied him.</p>

<p>They were near to the turn, with the horses
running close to the inner side, and still well in
hand.</p>

<p>Jonnasen thought quickly. It was a chance—the
only chance. One of them—both of them—might
escape if he could hit with the long iron hub
of the rear wheel the tough young white oak that
stood out on the very round of the sharp curve.</p>

<p>Jonnasen drew the horses in a little, spoke to
them quietly, then sent the front wheel past the
tree with a bite at the bark, pulled the team hard in,
and leaped.</p>

<p>There was a dull crash, a ripping of harness, and
a grinding crunch as the forty-ton stone slued over
the crushed wheel across the broken top of the
tree.</p>

<p>Jonnasen was picked up in the road, unconscious,
but not seriously hurt. The escape of Gustavesen
was more than luck. It was a miracle, but a miracle
worked by his own presence of mind, and the coolness,
quickness and good judgment of Jonnasen.</p>

<p>As the wheel struck, the traces parted, the pole-chains
snapped, and the horses shot ahead free, with
the boy clinging to the harness.</p>

<p>When he was helped down, his right leg was
found to be broken; but that had happened back
along the road, when he was snapped from the pole
while trying to unhook the forward teams. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was this that prevented his trying to fling himself
off to the road as his perilous ride began.</p>

<p>No harm had come to the shaft. The dray was
a wreck, but the great stone lay unbroken, and almost
unscratched, among the débris.</p>

<p>It was a week later, as both Gustavesens, father
and son, were convalescing, that they received a
letter, concluding as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Henceforth a man shall be a man here. Some
things have been done that the men in this quarry
are ashamed of. They believe now that every man
has a right to work and live under the law according
to the dictates of his own conscience.</p>

<p class="center">For the men,</p>

<h2 id="IN_THE_OVEN">IN THE OVEN</h2>

<p class="author">By Richard Washburn Child</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I am inclined to think that a girl’s wit is quicker
than a man’s in a tight place, if the place is
tight enough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Colchester had spoken after we had been
silently sitting for several minutes watching the
mist that was creeping over the moonlit water and
listening to the chirp of the crickets in the grass.</p>

<p>He always began a story by stating the moral.
His way was to present some conclusion and then
prove it by a personal experience.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of my sister,” he explained.
“She once saved us both from a fearful death. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
it had not been for her ready wit I should have
been a biscuit!”</p>

<p>At this every one straightened up perceptibly.
Mr. Colchester’s stories were always interesting.</p>

<p>“Perhaps all of you do not know that my father
was a cracker manufacturer,” he continued, “and
that he had a shop with machinery and three ovens
in it. Of course that would be considered nothing
to-day, when there are bakeries that supply thousands
of people in every part of the country, but
when I was a boy I remember I used to wonder
that there were enough mouths to consume all that
my father’s workmen made.</p>

<p>“I often went down to the shop, for it was really
fascinating to watch the mixers turning the great
rolls of dough over and over, and see the cutting-machines
chopping a long strap of it into little
sticky lumps. Then old Carberry, the baker,
would toss the pieces which had been patted and
molded by hand on the tiled floor of the oven.
Sometimes my sister Margaret used to go with
me, for we were great chums, and it was on one of
those occasions that we got into trouble.</p>

<p>“The day, I remember, had been rainy, and after
a discouraging attempt to amuse ourselves in the
house, Margaret said, ‘Let’s take umbrellas and
go down to the bakery.’</p>

<p>“I was so glad of the suggestion that I forgot
it was the noon hour, when the men would be
gone and the machinery shut down. It wasn’t
until we saw the deserted room that we remembered
it.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘we are bright, aren’t we? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
let’s look round—I’ll tell you, let’s look at the cool
oven.’</p>

<p>“‘Cool oven!’ exclaimed Margaret, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I explained to her that in the ordinary course
of business only two ovens were used, and that
unless there were extra orders there was always one
oven which was out of commission, being shut off
from the furnaces below by the big sheet-iron
dampers.</p>

<p>“I raised the latch of the heavy door and bent
down to look across the flat, tiled surface inside.</p>

<p>“‘It’s just like a cave, isn’t it, Bob?’ cried my
sister; and I laughed at the idea and asked her
whether she expected to see a bear or a robber
walk out.</p>

<p>“‘Of course I don’t!’ she said, for she always
was on her guard against my making fun of her.
‘Let’s crawl in.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ said I, touching the brick walls to
make sure I hadn’t made a mistake; and then I
followed her inside through the gloomy opening.</p>

<p>“‘Will it get my dress dirty?’ Margaret asked,
out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“‘No, indeed,’ said I. ‘They have to keep these
ovens clean as can be. They’re fussy about every
speck of dust.’</p>

<p>“I had hardly finished when the iron door behind
us shut with a resounding clang. One of
the workmen who had come back to work had
closed it!</p>

<p>“‘O Bob,’ cried my sister, with a little scream
of fright, ‘we’re shut in!’</p>

<p>“‘Like two biscuits,’ I laughed. ‘Don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
mind. All we have to do is to shout and some
one will come.’</p>

<p>“But Margaret was really scared, and groped
her way near me to put her hand on my shoulder.
I confess the darkness and the close, stuffy air
were far from cheerful.</p>

<p>“I began to call as loud as I could, and not getting
any answer, I crept over to the solid iron door
and began kicking it with my heels. After a moment
I stopped, breathing hard from my exercise,
and then I heard Margaret’s voice behind me,
saying:</p>

<p>“‘Wait a minute, Bob! Listen!’</p>

<p>“I strained my ears, and from the outside I could
hear a rumbling that seemed to come from far, far
away.</p>

<p>“‘It’s the machinery!’ I cried. ‘It’s after one
o’clock, and they have begun work again. No
wonder they couldn’t hear us!’</p>

<p>“By that time I had become really frightened,
and I suppose I must have temporarily lost my
head. I shouted wildly until my throat was sore,
but it seemed only to fill our oven trap with noise.
There was no hope whatever that it would penetrate
the thick brick walls. Suddenly I was startled
into silence by a sound of scraping iron underneath
us—a familiar noise to my ears. Some one had
pulled open the great damper that shut us off from
the fires in the cellar below! They were going to
heat our oven!</p>

<p>“‘What was that?’ exclaimed my sister, touching
my hand with her cold fingers. ‘What did that
noise mean, Bob?’ She seemed to know our danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
by instinct. I did not answer, for with a
sinking heart I felt on my face the first breath of
warm air!</p>

<p>“‘Tell me, Bob!’ demanded Margaret. ‘They
are heating this oven, aren’t they?’ She had
caught my wrist and pressed it as hard as a girl
could squeeze.</p>

<p>“‘Yes!’ I gasped, trying to speak bravely. I
remember I felt that if I were alone I should not
care nearly so much, but the idea that my little
sister would have to die, too, put me into another
panic.</p>

<p>“A second breath of air a good deal hotter than
the first fanned my cheek. I jumped up with a
scream, and beat and kicked upon the rough brick
walls and on the iron door in blind terror. Then,
exhausted, I crawled along the floor to the place
where Margaret sat. She was crying quietly—I
could tell because when I put my arm about her I
could feel that she was shaking.</p>

<p>“‘They will never, never hear us!’ she sobbed.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t cry, Margy,’ said I, patting her wet
cheek while I tried to arouse my own courage.
‘Perhaps there is another way.’</p>

<p>“I tried to think, but the heat had then become
almost unbearable; it stung my nose and seemed to
suffocate me. Once when I touched a place on one
of the tiles I drew my hand back in real pain.
There was no hope of breaking the latch of the
iron door, and no one could hear us, though we
put our mouths to a little crack at the top of the
door and screamed. I was sure we would be baked.
My arm was still round my sister, and her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was still in mine, as if she were seeking the comfort
of the touch.</p>

<p>“It was becoming hotter and hotter, but neither
of us spoke for several seconds. Then suddenly
Margaret started up and cried out, eagerly,
‘Tell me, Bob, quick! Have you got a piece of
paper?’</p>

<p>“I felt in my pockets. ‘Yes, I have an old postal
card!’ I exclaimed. ‘What are you going to do
with it?’</p>

<p>“‘They can’t hear us, but we can make them see!’
she cried. ‘Hurry! Give it to me—and your jack-knife!’</p>

<p>“I handed them to her, and she began to pick at
the hem of her skirt with the point of the knife.</p>

<p>“‘We need thread,’ she explained, excitedly,
‘and if this is a chain-stitch on this hem we can get
it!’ I lighted a match. ‘And it is, Bob, it is!’ she
cried. I realized that she had caught an end of
thread and was carefully ripping it out.</p>

<p>“‘Now, Bob,’ she commanded, handing me the
card, ‘punch a hole in the card and tie it through.’
Her voice was weak. From my own struggle to
keep my senses in the awful heat, I knew that she
was nearly at the collapsing point.</p>

<p>“‘What are you going to do with it?’ I gasped.</p>

<p>“‘The door!’ she answered, faintly. ‘Dangle the
card through the crack in the door!’ Then I understood
her plan at last, and crawling painfully over
on my knees, I thrust the postal card down
the little crack between the door and the iron
jamb.</p>

<p>“‘Pull it up and let it down!’ cried Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with a final effort, and I jiggled the string so that
the paper would dance upon the wall outside. My
head swam with the effect of the terrible heat, and
it seemed ages before any one came.</p>

<p>“Then suddenly the latch was lifted, the door
swung open, and in spite of the blinding daylight
which poured in I could see the astonished face of
old Carberry, the baker, peering in at us!</p>

<p>“I caught my sister’s dress, pulling her toward
the opening with all the strength that was left in
me, and fell out after her into the old man’s arms.</p>

<p>“That is why I say,” concluded Mr. Colchester,
as he looked round upon us with a smile, “that it
was a girl’s wit that kept me from being baked
like a biscuit. And that is the reason why I say
that a girl’s wit is the best in a tight place—providing
the place is tight enough.”</p>

<h2 id="ON_A_SLIDE-BOARD">ON A SLIDE-BOARD</h2>

<p class="author">By Robert Barnes</p>

<p class="dropcap">At three o’clock on an August morning the
press in the little printing-office on the summit
ceased its clatter, and Corey Green brought out
a bundle of <cite>Stars</cite>, wrapped in enameled cloth, to
Bart Collamore.</p>

<p>“Here’s your five hundred,” said Corey, “hot
from the types.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Bart “They’ll be on the
hotel counters twenty miles away by six.”</p>

<p>They walked down the platform before the Summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
House. A dim light illumined the office, but
the rest of the long building was dark. Only two
other persons were awake—Frank Simmons, busy
over the printing-press, and Luke Martin, the
hotel watchman.</p>

<p>Overhead an occasional star glimmered through
the driving wrack, and the low east disclosed the
first faint tokens of a cloudy dawn; but in the west
frowned a vaporous battlement, black and threatening,
from which a strong wind was tearing detached
masses and rolling them against the mountainside.
Now and then a few flakes of snow flew by on the
raw gale.</p>

<p>Lifting his slide-board from the platform, Bart
set it on the cog-rail midway of the track.</p>

<p>This rail was bolted to a wooden centerpiece on
the ties, and consisted of two parallel strips of
wrought angle-iron, connected by steel pins three
inches apart, on which the cogs of the engine
worked. He turned the nut on the brake-rod until
the iron plates by means of which the speed of the
board was retarded were in position under the
flanges of the rail. Then he pulled on his gloves,
jammed his cap down hard, and buttoned his reefer
up to his neck.</p>

<p>Corey glanced at the black western sky. “You’re
liable to hit the storm going down,” said he.</p>

<p>“Guess I can beat it out,” returned Bart. Seating
himself on the slide-board, with the bundle of
papers between his knees, he gripped the brake-handles.
Almost of itself the board began moving.</p>

<p>“I’ll be at the Base House in ten minutes!” he
called back, as he sped away down the slope toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the north, while behind him the drone of the wind
almost drowned Corey’s shout.</p>

<p>“Good luck!”</p>

<p>The slide-board was the conveyance used by employés
and trackmen in descending the mountain
railroad. Although perilous for a novice, it was
easy of management for an experienced hand. It
was of seven-eighths-inch spruce, ten inches wide,
and something over a yard long. Three cleats
screwed across its top kept it from splitting. Underneath
were two sets of “shoes,” the forward of
wood, the rear of iron, parallel strips half an inch
thick and four inches apart, just far enough for the
top of the cog-rail to slide between them.</p>

<p>As Bart slipped downward, the black buildings
on the summit were blotted out by driving clouds.
Little by little he swerved westward, turning his
back to the dawn, hearing only the hoarse murmur
of the rising gale and the rattle of his board.</p>

<p>Guide-books say that the three and one-third
miles from summit to base may be covered by slide-board
in twenty minutes. Actually, the record is
two minutes and forty-seven seconds. This can be
appreciated when one remembers that there is a
drop of four thousand feet, and that the average
grade approximates one in four. Bart had made
the trip some hundreds of times in his fourteen
years on the road. Every morning that summer he
had gone down before daybreak, in order that the
little paper printed on the peak might have early
distribution among the various hotels.</p>

<p>Faster and faster sped the board. The top of the
rack was abundantly lubricated with oil from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cogs of the engine, and the grade was growing
steeper. On the left a dim shaft flitted by, memorial
of a life lost by exposure on the mountain years
before.</p>

<p>Bart put a little more pressure on his brakes.
The stout birch handles, somewhat smaller than
baseball bats and about as long as the board itself,
were connected forward with the brake-rod running
across the front in a hollow wooden bar, and with
an iron plate under each flange of the rail. To retard
his course, the rider simply pulled up on the
handles, which were directly under his arms, thus
lifting the plates against the flanges and pressing
the board down harder on the top of the rack.</p>

<p>The track curved northwest for the next fifteen
hundred feet to the Gulf Tank, a water cistern on
the left. The grade varied from one in four to
one in eight. The wind, keen, strong, and shot with
hurrying snowflakes, stung even Bart’s seasoned
face.</p>

<p>He had worked on the mountain long enough
to know what was coming out of that inky bank
ahead.</p>

<p>Gulf Tank swept past, a square gray shadow,
and the track gradually swung west. And now he
caught it in good earnest. The moan of the blast
had risen to a furious howling. Bullets of sleet
pelted his cheeks. Right before him rose a black
wall, the edge of the real storm. It looked almost
as if it were solid. Catching his breath, he ducked
his head, and bolted straight into the heart of the
tempest.</p>

<p>In a second it enveloped him, rain, snow, sleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and hail. His board whizzed faster over the wet,
slippery rail.</p>

<p>The grade increased, and he knew he had reached
Long Trestle. Beyond lay Jacob’s Ladder, the
steepest place on the line, pitched considerably over
one in three. He must not go too fast there. It
was more than a mile and a half still to the bottom.
If the board once got away from him—</p>

<p>Bart stiffened himself against the fierce blast,
gripped the brake-handles hard, and pulled up on
them. A stream of sparks trailed out on each side,
as the plates bit at the flanges.</p>

<p>He was leaning well forward now, boring head
foremost into the yelling gale. His eyes were
closed; he could not keep them open.</p>

<p>Now the Trestle was past, and the Ladder lay
just ahead. He could tell where he was by the feel
of the track. His head was clear, his nerves steady.
All he needed to do was to keep a good hold on
those handles, and the board would soon carry him
safely to the base.</p>

<p>Suddenly his speed increased. He had struck the
Ladder. The grade at its head was not far from
one in two. Down he shot, lifting hard on the birch
bars.</p>

<p>What was that? It could not be that left brake-handle
was buckling! Yes! Something had given
way. Up came his hand, higher, higher, higher, yet
there was no response of iron grinding against iron.</p>

<p>For just a second Bart felt sick.</p>

<p>The flange was only three-fourths of an inch
wide. If that left plate once got out from under
it, he knew very well what would happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>A single brake could never hold the board on
the rail. On the next curve, if not before, it would
bound from the track with tremendous velocity, and
its rider would land somewhere on the rugged
mountainside with a broken neck. Somehow, if he
cared to live, that plate must never lose its grip
on the flange.</p>

<p>The Ladder was four hundred feet long and
thirty feet above the rocks at its highest point.
Bart was travelling forty miles an hour, so crossing
the trestle took less than ten seconds. Before
he left it, he saw what he must do.</p>

<p>Instinctively easing up on his right bar, so as to
bring an even pressure on both sides, he ran his
left hand quickly forward down the birch stick,
to locate the break. Not many inches from the
socket his fingers found it, where a knurl, imperceptibly
weakened by long use, had evidently
yielded at last.</p>

<p>Sitting where he did, he could just reach beyond
the break by extending his arm full length, and he
could exert only a slight upward pull. If he hoped
to keep the board on the rail, he must immediately
shift his position, so that he might put out his full
strength. Several short curves were just ahead.</p>

<p>To change one’s place on a narrow board flying
down a mountainside at forty miles an hour through
a pitch-black hurricane is no fool’s task. Very carefully
Bart hitched straight forward, until his knees
were upright, and he was able to lift strongly on
the unbroken portion of the bar. His speed was
now simply terrific.</p>

<p>Round a curve he whisked, leaning far inward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the fear that he might ride the rail. Then, as his
board settled down on a straightaway, he pulled up
with all his might.</p>

<p>To his horror, he found that with so short a leverage
he could not press the plate against the flange
hard enough to check his speed.</p>

<p>The board was running away with him!</p>

<p>Bart knew every yard of that track, every pitch
and curve, from the engine-house at the summit to
the Marshfield turntable; and he realized that this
was the most critical minute in all his years of railroading.
Two courses were open to him—he might
stick to the board, or he might roll off.</p>

<p>Which was the less dangerous?</p>

<p>If he rolled off at that speed, the best he could
hope for would be a fearful bruising, broken bones
and insensibility. It would be hours before rescuers
could find him; and hours in that storm meant
death.</p>

<p>If he stayed on, he took the chance of being
hurled from the rail at some curve; besides, what
would happen when he reached the bottom, if he
ever did reach it?</p>

<p>He decided to stay on.</p>

<p>The slide-board took the curves at express speed.
Time and again Bart thought it was flying off.
He wondered to find himself still sitting hunched
on the spruce, when Waumbek Tank slipped
by. He knew it had passed, although he did not
see it.</p>

<p>But little more than a mile due west, and almost
thirteen hundred feet lower, lay the terminus. Was
this to be his last ride on the line? In a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
minutes at the most the thing would be decided.
Bart manned himself for the finish.</p>

<p>On he shot, straining at the bars, head down
through the pitch darkness. He was dashing
against a forty-mile gale at an equal speed; that
was equivalent to standing still in a hurricane blowing
eighty miles. It shrieked round him with indescribable
fury, striving to hurl him backward from
his seat. His cap was torn away, and the sleet pattered
like a sand-blast on his bare skull.</p>

<p>Cold Spring Tank flitted past, and the last steep
pitch was near, seventeen hundred to the mile. In
a moment Bart was rushing madly down the
descent. His head swam with the hideous speed.
His board vibrated and trembled as it hurtled along
the track. All seemed unreal, uncanny. But although
dazed and buffeted, he never for an instant
loosed his grip of the bars. A “green” man might
have lost his head, and that could have had but one
result.</p>

<p>Almost sooner than he could think, he was at the
bottom of the pitch, darting over the Ammonoosuc
bridge. Only a few hundred feet more. The track,
he knew, was clear to its end, for cars and engines
were housed for the night. Now for one last, long,
hard pull!</p>

<p>Deaf, blind, numb, exhausted, bent almost double,
he drained his strength to the dregs for a clutch
on the handles; then he lifted, as if he would tear
the flange from the centerpiece.</p>

<p>There was a terrific shrieking as the iron surfaces
ground together. Fire followed each brake.</p>

<p>A building rushed by on the right—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
carpenter-shop. Bart did not actually see it, but he
knew it was gone.</p>

<p>Then came the car-barn, the turntable, the engine-house
and repair-shop, and the long wood-shed.
Less than thirty yards more! His speed
was slackening on the level grade, but it was still
tremendous.</p>

<p>And now the laundry was past—the last building.
Twenty-five feet beyond it the cog-rail ended.
Bart threw all that was left of himself into one
final, mighty wrench.</p>

<p>A second later he found himself rolling blindly
along the ties, head over heels and heels over head,
cuffed, punched, battered, as if a dozen flails were
beating him at once on every part of his body. At
last he came to a stop, a bruised, dizzy heap.</p>

<p>After a little Bart sat up, tried his arms and
legs, and found he could get on his feet. He felt
himself all over. Luckily his bones were well padded
with muscle, so none of them were broken.</p>

<p>The storm was still blowing forty miles an hour,
but by contrast it seemed to him to be almost over.
He hunted until he found his bundle of papers; it
had been tied tightly, and had not burst open.
Then he limped up to the Base House.</p>

<p>“Here are your ‘<cite>Stars</cite>,’” said he to the driver of
the team, shivering outside. “I’ve done my part;
now see if you can get ’em to Bethlehem before six
o’clock.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_CALL_OF_THE_SEA">THE CALL OF THE SEA</h2>

<p class="author">By Frederick Palmer</p>

<p class="dropcap">The only memory of his father that Franklin
Thompson had was the photograph of a
young naval officer in uniform which his mother,
with tears in her eyes, often showed him. She died
when Franklin was six, leaving him, her only cause
for living longer, to the care of his father’s brother.
When he realized how unwelcome he was in his new
home, the only solace he had in the world was the
photograph. He would look at it for an hour at a
time, and read again and again the inscription on
the back.</p>

<p>Before he was quite alone in the world he had
heard the sea a-calling. On his holidays he would
walk to the shore, and watch the ships go and come.
Each was a speaking individuality, which he would
recognize should he see it again. The salt breath
was ever in his nostrils, the tang of salt spray in his
veins.</p>

<p>When he was eleven, his cousin Edward, five
years his senior, received the appointment to
Annapolis. If Franklin felt any envy he stifled it.
The inscription on the photograph in his father’s
own hand forbade that.</p>

<p>“Be honest; envy nobody; strive hard,” it ran.</p>

<p>Two years later Franklin knew that his school-days
were at an end.</p>

<p>“I’ll look for a place for you to learn some business,”
said his uncle, as if the boy’s preferences for
an occupation did not count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Early the next morning Franklin went to the
great bay near his home, as he always did when he
was heavy of heart. Three men-of-war, one a new
battle-ship, their white sides gleaming, rested their
enormous weights on the water as gently as swans.
On the battle-ship it was visiting day. From her
side the monster reached down her big gangway,
with holystoned steps and immaculate rope, as a
gallant officer offers his hand to a lady.</p>

<p>At the threshold of the deck Franklin paused, as
one who suddenly sees his dreams materialize in
broad daylight. No one of the knots of sightseers,
going here and there with the spectators’ “Ahs!”
and occasional questions, noticed the boy, who stood
immovable, noting every detail of the leviathan.
Each gun seemed to him a living thing.</p>

<p>He saw some jackies going about their appointed
duties, and others under the shade of the awnings
aft, mending their clothes. The officer of the deck
must be the happiest man in the world, Franklin
thought. He imagined how his father must have
looked, pacing back and forth in the same way. Oh,
if his father were only alive, then perhaps he, too,
might go to Annapolis! He looked up at the bridge
and imagined himself in a great storm, with the
spray stinging his face and blinding his eyes, and
the mountain of steel as obedient to his commands
as a bicycle to the turn of the handle-bar.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to look around a bit?” asked
a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>Its owner, Franklin saw, was a boy of about his
own age, dressed like the jackies in summer white.</p>

<p>“Would I? Would I?” The way Franklin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
asked the question was answer enough from any
one boy to another.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll do,” said his new friend, laughing.
“My name’s Harry Grimm. I’m a ’prentice.”</p>

<p>Harry showed how the ammunition was hoisted
for the thirteen-inch gun by touching a button; he
slipped a dummy shell into the breech of one of the
three-inch rapid fires; but he was quite unable to
answer all of his guest’s questions.</p>

<p>Franklin did not leave the man-of-war until the
last boat was going ashore. That night he told his
uncle of his desire to join the navy as an apprentice.</p>

<p>Uncle William was in unusually bad temper.
He thought a moment and then said:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ll ever be any use in business.
Probably you’d run away to sea if I got you a place.
I’ll take you to the navy-yard to-morrow.”</p>

<p>At any rate, Uncle William thought, he would be
free from any further responsibility or care for the
boy. Nevertheless, he knew what Franklin’s proud
father or his proud mother, were either of them
alive, would say. That thought stung him a little.</p>

<p>While his cousin was at the school where officers
are made, Franklin was to be trained for a seaman.
Edward would begin his career with rank and position
just beyond the highest grade that Franklin
could ever attain. Franklin must be ever on the
forecastle side of the dividing line between officer
and man. He might rise to be a chief gunner, while
Edward might be an admiral.</p>

<p>But Franklin did not understand this. He was
in the period of light-hearted youth when the responsibility
for his future rested on his guardian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
shoulders. He was entirely under the spell of the
call of the sea.</p>

<p>A year later found him bound for South America
on a small cruiser, which continued around the
Horn and on to Hongkong to join the Asiatic
squadron, which was even then preparing for the
conflict with Spain. In all that long voyage he had
never once been seasick, and he had grown to love
the sea from familiarity as much as he had loved
it in anticipation.</p>

<p>On that great morning when the American men-of-war
ran into Manila Bay, the executive officer
set him to look for torpedo-boats. The story of how
he reported, with his hand to his cap in salute,
“Torpedo-boat on our starboard bow, sir; she’s
sinking by the bow, sir; she’s sunk,” went the round
of the messes. After the battle came that long
period of waiting until the army took the city.
When the sun was not as hot as an oven, the clouds
poured torrents that rose from the hot awnings in
steam.</p>

<p>By this time Franklin had come to comprehend
the separation of officer and man as only actual
service can reveal it. Sometimes, with cap in hand,
he had to pass through the ward-room and the
officers’ quarters. These, which had been his
father’s portion, would be his cousin’s, but could
never be his.</p>

<p>His fellow apprentices were quite content with
the forecastle. They felt more at home aft than
they would forward. There was Charley, for example.
Charley studied as little as he might; he
was always getting into mischief, but was withal a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
bright, good-hearted fellow, with the makings of a
first-class seaman in him.</p>

<p>The boatswain, known as “Pete” in the forecastle
and “Deering” forward—and there you have his
two names—used to fend off intrusion when Franklin
was busy with his books. All his studies had the
requirements for admission to Annapolis in view.
Not that he expected ever to have his learning put
to the test. He knew no one, he had no hope of
knowing any one, who could secure for him the
coveted appointment. It pleased him to be ready.</p>

<p>One day, as he was bending over the little box
which is at once a seaman’s work-basket and wardrobe,
the captain, who had strolled aft, stopped by
his side, and looking over his shoulder, saw a photograph.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s Thompson!” he exclaimed. “Is he
any relation of yours?”</p>

<p>“My father, sir,” Franklin replied, as he sprang
to his feet and saluted.</p>

<p>“I did not know that,” the captain repeated,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>He picked up the photograph, and scanned the
face of his old messmate. Afterward he never
passed Franklin without a smiling glance. But
that glance, meant so kindly, had a sting. It
seemed to say that he was in a position unworthy
of his father’s name.</p>

<p>When a visiting congressman of the United
States came aboard the cruiser as a guest, Pete instantly
sought out Franklin, and taking him to one
side where he would not be overheard, said:</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance, my bully boy. A congressman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
can do ’most anything, so they say. You go
right up to this one and knock your cap smart as
you can, and tell him who your father was and that
you want to go to Annapolis.”</p>

<p>Franklin had not the courage or the presumption,
whichever you call it; Pete called it
“gall.”</p>

<p>“If you won’t, sonny, I will.”</p>

<p>And when he saw the congressman sitting on the
deck after general quarters, he approached him
with a eulogy as earnest as it was picturesque. The
congressman smiled, and asked to see Franklin.</p>

<p>“Now, sonny,” said Pete, “I’ve cleared the channel;
go forward and do your evolutions.”</p>

<p>As Franklin stood before the elderly, dignified
man sitting beside the captain on the captain’s deck,
he felt himself to be quite the most insignificant
apprentice in the world. The congressman looked
him over keenly from head to foot, as if he were
examining the texture of the cloth on the back of
his jacket.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go to Annapolis?”</p>

<p>Did he want to? Does the tender shoot of
spring want the sunlight? Franklin’s voice trembled
with hope:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. More than anything else in the world.”</p>

<p>“I’m not making any promises,” the congressman
said, finally. “Congressmen haven’t a pocketful
of blanks to fill out whenever they see a bright
boy. I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p>When, by the rules of the navy, Franklin was
supposed to be sound asleep that night, he was wide
awake, building air-castles. How long would he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
have to wait before he heard from the congressman?
Would he ever hear?</p>

<p>The statesman did not appear again aboard the
cruiser for many days. In the meantime, a new
cadet, with his stripe fresh on his arm, came to the
cruiser. It was none other than Franklin’s own
cousin, Edward. When they met at drill there
was no look of recognition in Edward’s face.
Later, in one of the intervals of the day which the
forecastle may call its own, the officer came aft
and in a patronizing manner asked the apprentice
how he was getting on. When Franklin told him
very well, Edward said it was awkward for an
officer to have a cousin in the forecastle, and walked
away. Franklin flushed at the remark, and repeated
under his breath his father’s advice, as the
soldier of the old, superstitious days repeated his
talisman.</p>

<p>The next day Franklin had shore leave. On his
way back to the quay he saw his fellow apprentice,
Charley, in bad company. He forgot all else except
his friend’s plight and his horror over it.
When, finally, he had separated Charley from the
lounger who wanted to show the sailor boy the
town, the cruiser’s launch had gone. They had to
hire a native to row them out in a banka, which
crept at a snail’s pace in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Franklin was among
the accused who stood at the mast the next morning
to hear their sentences from the captain, who
acts as judge, and with the captain was the
congressman. Franklin saw his look of surprise as
their eyes met. The captain spoke of his own grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in delivering sentence of suspension from leave
privilege for six months.</p>

<p>Franklin’s head swam, and his cheeks were
aflame. He could only reply with a hoarse “Yes,
sir.”</p>

<p>As he turned to go he heard the congressman say
sarcastically that he did not think “that boy was so
very anxious to go to Annapolis.”</p>

<p>Franklin was the only one of the ship’s company
who did not brighten when they received the electric
thrill of an order, which broke their weary vigil in
the famous bay by sending the cruiser to patrol duty
among the southern islands. But when they were
under way Franklin found that the congressman
was still aboard, and his hopes revived a little. For
a week of coasting from port to port he looked in
vain for some event which would set him right.</p>

<p>Then came an order transferring him. He was
assigned to the <i>Marietta</i>, a tiny gunboat no bigger
than a harbor tugboat and with but half the draft.
He had only time to get his belongings together,
which does not take a sailor long. He found that
his cousin had also been transferred, and was to be
commander of the cockle-shell.</p>

<p>The <i>Marietta’s</i> first assignment was to take none
other than the congressman up a river to the capital
of a province where he had a son, an officer of the
army, in command of the garrison. There Franklin
would definitely see the last of him. They had no
thought of meeting with any delay on their run of
the five miles of winding stream, but it is when they
are least expected that guerrillas appear.</p>

<p>The congressman was sitting in the bow admiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the scenery, the little engine was “chugging” earnestly,
the screw was whirling vigorously through
the muddy water, when out of the soft green foliage
of the right bank cracked a volley. The congressman,
a veteran himself, dropped on the deck and
looked about him for a rifle, his old eyes flashing.</p>

<p>The cadet had never been under fire before. He
dodged and fell on the deck with the others.
Franklin was at the wheel and remained erect,
frightened but not forgetting his duty. There had
not been a tremor of the rudder.</p>

<p>“Steer for that bank, sharp, sharp!” Edward
called, and Franklin obeyed. “I don’t want to—to
endanger your life,” he panted to the congressman,
his sentence broken by the ring of a bullet against
the hull, and whistle of other bullets over their
heads.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I’d put a few shots back at ’em
in the meanwhile,” said the congressman. “What’s
that for?” He nodded toward a rapid-fire gun in
the bow. “And that?” toward a one-pounder in
the stern.</p>

<p>Edward could not fail to take the hint. He
sprang up with trembling limbs and ran to the
rapid-fire gun, calling for the other to be manned.
A bullet struck its support before he could put it
in action. That made him forget all his training.
He aimed wildly, and jammed the delicate machine
almost instantly. Then, in his desperation, he ran
toward the wheel.</p>

<p>“Steer in closer, closer!”</p>

<p>“It’s too shallow, sir,” Franklin replied.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not.” The ensign could hear the triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
shouts of the insurgents, who increased
their fire. He was wild with exasperation. “It’s
not!” he repeated, and seized the wheel in his own
hands and turned it hard alee. The bow veered
sharply. For an instant the boat flew forward,
then grounded.</p>

<p>As if they had been waiting on this for a signal,
a fire broke out from some bushes which rose above
the level of the grassy bank on the left side.</p>

<p>“Both sides!” gasped the ensign. He sprang
overboard, as much to avoid the fire as anything.
“Push her off!”</p>

<p>Everybody leaped into the water. When the insurgents
on the left bank saw the predicament of
the Americans, they broke out of their cover with
a yell, and came running toward them. Meanwhile,
the <i>Marietta</i> was still in range of the fire from the
other side. It was a question only of minutes, yes,
of seconds, before they would be prisoners.</p>

<p>The current swung the <i>Marietta</i> partially round
and drove her fast into the soft mud, and the misdirected
efforts of her crew to free her were as unavailing
as if she were a battle-ship.</p>

<p>“Can’t somebody fire that gun? Can’t somebody
fire?” the congressman called, putting the strength
of his sixty years against the hull, and feeling his
shoes sinking in the soft ooze beneath them.</p>

<p>At this juncture, in face of the fire, Franklin
sprang on deck, and ran aft to the jammed instrument
of their hope. He felt as cool as his father’s
son ought to feel under such circumstances. The
parts of the mechanism were not a jumble to him
as they were to the excited cadet, and he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
difficulty and how simple it was. His study, his
questions, had not been in vain.</p>

<p>“Man the one-pounder! Get the rifles, everybody!”
he called, with the instinct of command.</p>

<p>As they tumbled aboard the crew heard the rat-tat-tat
of the gun under Franklin’s hand, sweeping
the field of white-shirted figures pressing forward,
and soon a little shell from the one-pounder threw
up dirt at their feet. The insurgents were too near
their prize to be stopped yet.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, everybody, keep cool!” said the
congressman, himself firing with the nice calculation
of a man at a range.</p>

<p>The Americans did not realize that shots were
still coming from the rear. They knew that the
insurgents on the other side of the stream could
not cross it, and that was enough. If the gun should
jam again, all would be lost.</p>

<p>But it did not jam; and soon the insurgents, no
longer able to stand the persistent accuracy of the
machine, began to fall back, and finally ran in pell-mell
flight, leaving their wounded behind.</p>

<p>Promptly Franklin whirled his gun round and
began firing upon the first attacking party, which
withdrew when it saw that it was unsupported by
the other side.</p>

<p>When excitement no longer made their efforts
futile, and one was not pushing against another, and
with the screw properly directed to their assistance,
the crew was very soon able to force the stranded
<i>Marietta</i> back into the stream.</p>

<p>After the congressman had emptied the water
out of his shoes and was once more seated, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
nothing to do but to enjoy the scenery, he said to
Franklin, in beaming gratitude:</p>

<p>“Well, young man, you’re quite a general!”</p>

<p>Franklin blushed. The remark did not make him
think of his ambition. It gave him speech for
another cause.</p>

<p>“O sir, I want you not to believe that those
charges were true. They weren’t. I wouldn’t have
overstayed leave if it hadn’t been—but—but you
ask Charley the rest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe them. To prove it, all you’ve
got to do is to pass the examination to Annapolis.
I’ll see that you get the appointment.”</p>

<p>Franklin’s manner and his eyes spoke his gratitude
better than his tongue. Edward, who had
overheard, looked proudly at his cousin, and then
said to the congressman:</p>

<p>“I thank you, too, sir! I sha’n’t be happy till he
wears the uniform his father wore. He saved us
all to-day.”</p>

<p>His little speech saved Edward from a court of
inquiry. He became Franklin’s best friend, and if
ever he goes into action again there is no doubt
that he will behave like a veteran.</p>

<h2 id="ON_A_TIGHT_ROPE">ON A TIGHT ROPE</h2>

<p class="author">By Albert W. Tolman</p>

<p class="dropcap">“My highest ambition at seventeen,” said the
linotype operator, “was to become a professional
acrobat. I then lived with my parents on
a farm near the manufacturing town of N. All
my spare time was spent in vaulting, jumping,
turning handsprings, and practising other feats of
strength and agility.</p>

<p>“On the Fourth of July a travelling tight-rope
performer, Signor Lupini of Verona, as the posters
called him, was to display his skill on a rope above
the river that flowed through the town. He arrived
with two assistants on the afternoon of July
3d, and a crowd of boys, myself among them, met
him at the railroad station. We saw a spare, wiry
man, above the ordinary height, light-complexioned,
with steely-blue eyes. He looked us over inquiringly.</p>

<p>“‘Boys,’ said he, ‘I need some young fellow to
help me to-morrow. Who wants to be wheeled
across the rope in a barrow?’</p>

<p>“The others hung back; but I jumped at the
chance. ‘I do!’ I exclaimed, quickly. He seemed
pleased as he ran his eyes over me. I was of
medium height, with good muscles.</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ he said. ‘Come to the hotel at
seven, and I’ll tell you what’s wanted.’</p>

<p>“At the stroke of the hour I was on hand, and he
explained my duties. Then he pulled a ten-dollar
bill from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That’s yours at nine to-morrow night if you
do your work well,’ he said. ‘Now go home and
sleep soundly.’</p>

<p>“My parents were spending the Fourth with
cousins in a neighboring town, so I was alone in
the house. I went to bed early, but until long
after midnight excitement kept me from getting
a single wink.</p>

<p>“The next day I was on hand bright and early.
I helped stretch the rope between two mill roofs,
ran errands, and made myself generally useful.
When not busy I hung about, watching my employer.
He certainly was an artist in his line, a
man without bravado, either all nerves or none at
all. I could not help thinking, too, that for an
Italian he spoke English remarkably well.</p>

<p>“At half past two a carriage took us from the
hotel to the western mill. We dressed in the loft.
The signor donned his tinsel-spangled tights. I
figured as clown in an old stovepipe hat and white
cotton suit, liberally besprinkled with stars of red
and green. The same colors streaked my face.
As we clambered through the scuttle, the crowds
lining the bridges and banks set up a shout, and the
town band on the other mill began playing ‘The
Star-Spangled Banner.’</p>

<p>“Sharp at three o’clock the music stopped. The
assistant on our roof advanced to the edge, fired
six blank cartridges from a self-cocking revolver,
and shouted this magniloquent announcement
through a megaphone:</p>

<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen, the celebrated Signor
Lupini will now illustrate his art, assisted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Rinaldo Nobisco, the famous clown, recently
secured from the London hippodrome, ladies and
gentlemen, at great trouble and expense.’</p>

<p>“Whistles and catcalls from the boys below
greeted this absurd reference to me, and I felt
rather foolish. Signor Lupini stepped briskly forward,
bowed to his audience and was soon promenading
along the spidery line between the two
cornices. Aided by a long balancing-pole, he stood
on one foot, knelt, lay down, walked across blindfold,
and performed many other marvelous feats.
His perfect control of nerve and muscle fascinated
me. I did not realize that his facility came from
years of toilsome practice.</p>

<p>“Here was the calling for me. I resolved to
stretch a rope the very next day between the beams
over the haymow.</p>

<p>“During the signor’s exhibition the crowd was
very quiet, and the band did not play. It was only
when he was once more safe upon the roof that
their long-restrained applause broke forth, and
the band struck up ‘Hail to the Chief.’ He rested
a few minutes, and then motioned to me to make
ready.</p>

<p>“Among our paraphernalia was a strong, light
wheelbarrow with a tire grooved to fit the rope.
I began to feel a little shaky; but there was no time
to indulge this emotion, for my employer exclaimed:
‘All aboard, my boy, and remember, a
stiff upper lip!’</p>

<p>“I seated myself, facing forward, my feet dangling
on each side of the wheel. Signor Lupini,
stooping, gripped the handles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Sit steady,’ he said. ‘Don’t wink one eye unless
you wink the other at the same time.’</p>

<p>“He ran me a few turns round the graveled surface,
then flicked the wheel dexterously up on the
rope and headed straight for the edge.</p>

<p>“‘Keep perfectly still,’ he adjured me, ‘and
you’re as safe as you’d be on the street.’</p>

<p>“For all my assumption of coolness, I was
frightened half out of my wits. I shut my eyes
for a moment, and when I opened them we were
fairly out on the tremulous hemp.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t look down,’ cautioned the signor. ‘Face
straight forward. Sit tight.’</p>

<p>“Hardly daring to breathe, I stiffened myself as
if I were in a plaster cast. I could see the narrow
line just ahead buckle slightly at the approach of
the wheel. How long that two hundred feet seemed!</p>

<p>“Slowly, surely, we drew near the roof. The
tire jolted against the cornice. In two or three
seconds we were safely on the gravel. Then the
band blared out and the crowds set off explosives.
My fright was over, and I felt proud as a peacock.</p>

<p>“On the trip back my employer made me sit facing
him, and I had a good chance to admire the
easy, effortless play of his wiry muscles. He was
a thorough gymnast, a man of steel and india-rubber.
After several other trips, during which I
occupied different positions on the barrow, we
went back to the hotel.</p>

<p>“Promptly at eight we emerged again through
the scuttle. A crowd bigger than that of the afternoon
had gathered, and a roar of applause greeted
us. I say ‘us,’ for by this time I felt myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
be almost as important as Signor Lupini. My
head was completely turned.</p>

<p>“The evening performance possessed certain
novel features. Tin pans of red fire stood on each
cornice, and along the bridge-rails had been stationed
a half-dozen boys liberally supplied with
rockets and Roman candles.</p>

<p>“The master of ceremonies fired an introductory
volley with his revolver.</p>

<p>“‘Light up, Jimmy!’ he shouted to his associate
across the river, at the same time touching a match
to the pan beside him. Jimmy obeyed. A deep
red glow illuminated the scene, flashing from the
mill windows, and revealing the human clusters on
bridges and banks.</p>

<p>“As in the afternoon, Signor Lupini began with
a few feats performed alone, the blaze of fireworks
making his spangled tights glitter. I waited impatiently
for our dual performance, thirsting for
some of the applause. Finally my turn came, and
the signor wheeled me back and forth several times.
So great was my confidence in him that I had forgotten
my nervousness.</p>

<p>“At last nine o’clock was near.</p>

<p>“‘Now, my boy,’ said my employer, ‘we’ll wind
up with something I don’t try very often. I see
you have good grit.’</p>

<p>“He screwed to the barrow sides a light, strong
chair of steel, its seat a yard in air. After helping
me into this, he passed me a long-handled pan
of red fire. We were to close in a blaze of glory.
‘Keep cool,’ said he, ‘and we’ll give ’em something
to look at.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“He trundled me up to the cornice, his assistant
dropped a lighted lucifer into the pan, and we
moved out on the rope amid the crimson glare and
the whizzing of rockets. The crowd yelled, and
one of the boys setting off fireworks from the lower
bridge lost his head.</p>

<p>“<em>Whi-s-s-sh!</em> A badly aimed rocket shot not five
feet over our heads, showering us with sparks. A
little lower, and it would have dashed us from the
rope. Signor Lupini drew a quick breath. I
cringed in my steel chair, but still kept tight hold
of the pan handle. The sudden fright set my teeth
chattering. My employer noticed my trepidation.</p>

<p>“‘Keep quiet, my boy, and we’ll get over all
right,’ said he, reassuringly, cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>“On we rolled, smoothly and steadily. We were
about half-way across when the unlucky rocketeer
on the lower bridge outdid his previous blunder.
A warning shriek blended with the swish of a projectile.
I dared not turn my head, but a sidelong
glance revealed a fiery comet heading straight toward
us. Signor Lupini saw it, too, and could not
repress a cry of alarm. The next second it was
upon us. I shut my eyes, convinced that we were
lost. A whir, a rushing of flame, a slight shock!
The apparition had passed, and we were still on the
rope.</p>

<p>“I was hardly daring to congratulate myself
when my heart was chilled by a low groan behind
me. The barrow wabbled. The signor was trembling
violently, swaying, reeling like a drunken
man; every throb of his body came to me through
the tight-clutched handles. Something fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
must have happened. I clung to the chair arms in
sheer paralysis of horror. An accident would hurl
us down seventy-five feet into the river, where
drowning or maiming worse than death awaited
us.</p>

<p>“We moved a few feet farther, then stopped.
The barrow swayed, as if about to overturn.
Another groan from the signor. I would have
questioned him, but the words died in my throat.
Perhaps he had been pierced by the rocket, and
might at any instant fall unconscious.</p>

<p>“Cries of horror rose from the spectators. The
rockets and Roman candles ceased. The entertainment
threatened to become a tragedy.</p>

<p>“Again we started, moving intermittently. Now
a few quick steps would fill me with the dread of
being flung off; now we almost stopped, and I
feared we should never go on. Before and behind
us fizzed the red fire. Signor Lupini’s feet shuffled
on the rope, his breath came hard. Not a word in
explanation, but always those terrible groans. My
hair bristled.</p>

<p>“With straining eyes I stared ahead into the red
glare on the approaching mill. How slowly the
distance lessened! On the roof stood Jimmy, gazing
at us, pale and open-mouthed. The speechless
horror on his face reflected our peril.</p>

<p>“The cornice was only ten feet off. Signor
Lupini thrust the barrow suddenly forward. A
second later the wheel grated on the gravel; it was
none too soon. As a long sigh of relief rose from the
spellbound crowds, the gymnast collapsed into a
writhing heap. It took three men to get him down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
through the scuttle and into the carriage that conveyed
him to his hotel.</p>

<p>“The rocket had struck his right calf a glancing
blow. His skill had enabled him to withstand a
shock that would have overthrown a clumsier man;
but his muscles, steeled to resist, had cramped
violently, and we had been in deadly peril all
the way across. Two lives had hung on his
ability to resist the agonizing pains and preserve
his poise.</p>

<p>“That last hundred feet decided me that I didn’t
care to be a professional acrobat. The tight rope
was never stretched between the beams of the
haymow.”</p>

<h2 id="DOWN_THE_INCLINE">DOWN THE INCLINE</h2>

<p class="author">By Charles Newton Hood</p>

<p class="dropcap">“All that I had to do to earn my one hundred
and twenty-five dollars a week salary was,
four times each week-day, to climb to the top of
a high tower, mount a bicycle, ride it down a long,
narrow incline, pitched at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, then up a few feet and out through
the air, across a gap of thirty feet to another platform,
and so to the ground.”</p>

<p>It was John Manser who was speaking, formerly
one of the most daring performers in what is called
the carnival business.</p>

<p>“No, I am not doing that sort of an act now.</p>

<p>“My mother had been writing to me, begging me
to stop, but I was looking forward to getting married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and that one hundred and twenty-five dollars
a week was making the nest-egg grow.</p>

<p>“I was one of the ‘feature’ acts furnished by the
Ferari Brothers to street fairs, carnivals and the
like, and had stepped from construction boss to
performer one day by taking the place of an indisposed
athlete at an hour’s notice, and leaping the
gap successfully on his bicycle without any previous
rehearsal. I was at once put on as a regular performer
with the company.</p>

<p>“My work did not seem so very terrible to me.
With the bands playing and with the thousands of
happy spectators looking on, it was rather pleasant
than otherwise to climb to the top of the high
platform, dressed in my gay costume, and at the
word, come hurtling down the steep run, and then
up and out through the air like a bird.</p>

<p>“All that seemed to be required was to be absolutely
sure that the apparatus was put up strong
and perfectly true, and that the gap was of exactly
the correct width. Mine was precisely twenty-eight
feet and four inches. I always superintended the
erection of everything myself, and trued every part
up with the utmost care.</p>

<p>“In the act itself, it required only strong hands
and arms to keep the bicycle steady and straight
down the run, and to lean back a little and give a
strong up pull on the handle-bar when we ‘took off’
for the jump, so that the machine would surely
strike on the rear wheel on the other side, to prevent
the shock which would throw me headlong if the
front wheel should strike first, or even at the same
instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“All summer long I had enjoyed the work, and
I often wondered that they should pay me so much
for such a simple thing. Even when the performer
who ‘looped-the-loop’ on a bicycle in another part of
the grounds fell and was crippled for life, I ascribed
it to the fact that his health was not very good, and
that he sometimes resorted to stimulants to help
him through his act; and his misfortune did not
render me at all nervous regarding my own work.</p>

<p>“It was the last day of the carnival at Grand
Creek. We had had a most successful week, and
on the closing night it was estimated that not less
than fifteen thousand people crowded the grounds.
The last of my four rides for the day was scheduled
for eleven o’clock at night, and was to be the
closing feature.</p>

<p>“Promptly at five minutes of eleven I climbed to
the platform, and my bicycle was sent up to me by
rope and pulley. It was a heavy, dark night, but
the thousands of electric lights made the grounds
almost as light as day. Little lamps were strung
thickly all down the run, and the skeleton framework
of my tower and trestles was outlined with
them.</p>

<p>“A fitful, eddying wind had come up, which
roared dismally through the timbers. It swayed the
big framework somewhat, but not enough to trouble
me.</p>

<p>“The people had come crowding to my portion
of the grounds, and as I gazed down at their upturned
faces, massed so thickly together below me,
the sight was a weird one under the electric lights.</p>

<p>“Straight ahead of me lay the narrow run, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
its broad stripe of white down the center, to aid me
in steering, then the ‘saucer,’ as it was called, at the
bottom, where the run turned up toward the ‘take-off,’
then the wide gap and the farther platform,
with its even wider guiding stripe of white.</p>

<p>“I gave the bicycle a quick examination, stood
up straight and made the little posing flourish which
is expected of all athletes, fixed my bicycle on the
run, and seated myself firmly. The official announcer
below raised his hand. The band stopped
playing, and there was that breathless hush of apprehension
and expectation which is so carefully
worked up for sensational acts.</p>

<p>“‘All ready?’ shouted the announcer.</p>

<p>“‘Right!’ I responded.</p>

<p>“‘Go!’</p>

<p>“The snare-drummer of the band struck into the
long roll with which he always accompanied my
flights. Instantly I removed the restraining foot
which I had kept upon the platform, placed it upon
the locked pedal, and shot rapidly down the incline.</p>

<p>“At that instant every electric light in the city of
Grand Creek went out!</p>

<p>“It was a darkness doubly dense and awful after
the brilliancy of the moment before. Perfectly
helpless, I was plunging down a steep, narrow incline
toward probable death. If the wheel swerved
but a little to the right or left, I should sweep over
the edge and be dashed to pieces on the ground
below.</p>

<p>“My bicycle, rushing down the incline, travelled
at the rate of fifty miles an hour. Sometimes now
I awake at night with a gasp of horror from having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lived over those awful moments, but at the time
my thoughts were cool and collected.</p>

<p>“‘It all depends on you, Jack, my boy,’ I told
myself. ‘You can’t be smashed any harder for
keeping your head.’</p>

<p>“I knew that the wheel was absolutely straight
for the jump when I started, and grasping the handles,
I bent every effort toward keeping the wheel
perfectly rigid. Down I rushed through the darkness,
and so strange was the sensation that it almost
seemed as if the wheel had left the run, and was
sailing through the air. The speed seemed doubly
terrific. Even if I kept the run, could I hold the
wheel for the jump and what then?</p>

<p>“The saucer came almost before I expected it.
In spite of myself I must have given a spasmodic
twist to the handles, for the wheel twisted in my
hands and swerved. I threw myself frantically to
one side and lost consciousness!</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m alive yet. Entirely uninjured except
for the thump which put me to sleep when I struck
the platform.</p>

<p>“The great momentum swept both the wheel and
myself from the edge of the take-off and hurled us
against the yielding bodies of those in the front row
of the crowd, backed by the thousands of other
spectators, as against a carefully prepared and
cushioned buffer. It was learned that not less than
eighteen persons received the impact of the wheel
and myself at the same instant, and so scattered
was the blow that nobody was injured in the
slightest.</p>

<p>“One very fat man, who had been standing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
his handsome top-hat held behind him, told me that
he sat down with fearful suddenness after receiving
my head in his stomach, and he showed me his hat;
but he wasn’t hurt.</p>

<p>“The next day the Ferari Brothers Carnival
Company went to Battle Rapids, but my ticket
read East Putney, Vermont.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_COST_OF_LOVING">THE COST OF LOVING</h2>

<p class="author">By Frederick Orin Bartlett</p>

<p class="dropcap">With a slight lift of his heavy shoulders, Dr.
Schriftman brought to a close his final lecture
of the year to the senior medical class. For
a moment he faced these young men aggressively.
With his shaggy white beard, his wiry gray hair,
his bulky body, he looked more like some good-natured
Santa Claus than a surgeon who was
famous on two continents for his stoicism as well
as his skill. It was tradition that he should say
what he was about to say to each graduating
class.</p>

<p>“Shentlemen,” he began in his rough guttural,
which still retained the trace of an accent.
“Shentlemen, you are about to enter a brofession
which will be very jealous of you. It demands all—everything.
You will be tempted by many false
gods—by women, by gold. Peware! Let your
work be your religion, your wife, and your reward.
So you will be goot surgeons. Shentlemen, I wish
you success.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>As he turned to leave the platform, he was
greeted with noisy and hearty cheering.</p>

<p>“Raus mit der ladies!” shouted some one.</p>

<p>The cry was taken up with a will, but when
another voice broke through with: “Hoch Schriftman!”
the one hundred throats strained themselves
to the utmost in a final effort to give expression to
their genuine appreciation of the man.</p>

<p>But Schriftman, indifferent alike to their jests
and plaudits, had already jammed his silk hat on
the back of his head and was hurrying down stairs to
where his machine waited to whisk him to the
hospital.</p>

<p>He timed his day as by a stop watch. He rose at
seven, gave himself until eight to finish his solitary
breakfast, and, hurrying off to the medical school,
remained there until eleven. He was at the hospital
from eleven-thirty until three. From three-ten
until five he kept his office hours. He generally
dined alone in his apartments after this
and gave up his evenings to consultations, to
the preparation of papers, and to study. It was
a long evening, for he seldom retired until two.
More often than not he was called to the hospital
after this and finished his sleep there. The doctors’
quarters were as much home to him as the
three book-cluttered rooms which led from his
office. And yet there were men—young men, too—who
envied Schriftman, and when tempted by
bright eyes and warm cheeks quoted to themselves
his famous epigram:</p>

<p>“It costs too much to love.”</p>

<p>As his machine drew up before the big gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
building, a young interne hurried out, opened the
door, and then fell back respectfully to give to his
senior the place of honor by Schriftman’s side. In
answer to questions which went to their mark like
arrows, Burrell covered the progress of every case
since the day before and turned to the new patient
in Ward 27.</p>

<p>“Female, age eight. Mother an actress, died of
pneumonia; father a bicycle rider, killed in an accident.
Family history negative.”</p>

<p>And so with a dozen other medical details Burrell
led up to the result of his preliminary examination
and to the laboratory report. He made no
diagnosis except in connection with her weak heart.
But to Schriftman it was not the faulty heart but
the chronic pain in the back which was significant.
As he removed his hat and gloves before going to
the ward, he pressed his cross-examination deeper.
It was evident to Dr. Burrell that it was to be the
rare good fortune of this female, age eight, to prove
an interesting case to Schriftman.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the lass in question lay
stretched out on her back, watching with hectic interest
the hurried movements of the head nurse.
There wasn’t very much of Gretzel left; just a
shriveled body, a thin mouth, a straight, sensitive
nose, a pair of blue eyes, and a wealth of light hair.
But the eyes were quite perfect. So deep and clear,
so timid and yet so wise were these that as they
peered out of the haggardness of their surroundings
they gave the effect of a maid within a maid.
It was as though some other soul, unrelated to this
pain-racked body, were peering through the mask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of her gaunt features. The eyes were younger
and fresher and stronger than the rest of her. At
present they were unusually alert.</p>

<p>In contrast to the isolated boarding-house room
from which they had brought her, life here fairly
buzzed. The plaints and groanings of her fellow
patients, the shadow-like movements of the nurses,
the constant coming and going of the young doctors
on their unknown errands, the catlike tread of
life through the night, the undercurrent of suspense,
and her own helplessness in the midst of it
kept her on guard. The nurses, drawn to her at
once, tried to reassure her, but to little purpose,
because Gretzel believed nothing of what they
whispered. People had lied to her all her life.
When her father had told her she would soon be
well and that then he would take her far out into
the country, he had lied. When her father was
killed, her mother had lied to her, saying that daddy
had only gone away for a little while to prepare a
home for them both. Then her mother had died
and every one had lied about that. They said that
she had gone to join daddy and that some day she
would send for Gretzel. Finally the landlady had
lied when she had been hurried off into the ambulance.
This woman had assured Gretzel that she
might possibly find her mother at the hospital.
She hadn’t found her mother—the nurses had
never heard of her mother. So now, with her thin
lips tight together, she listened, believing nothing,
but kept her eyes wide open ready for what might
happen next.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to her came Fate in the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of Schriftman—Schriftman the silent, who could
skirt with his knife the fringe of the soul itself.
His progress through the ward was accompanied
with more awe than that of a sovereign through
his court. To the huddled group of internes at
his back he stood for the highest goal in their profession;
to those patients who knew him he stood as
the literal arbiter of life and death. When those
clear eyes—as brilliantly hard as glacial ice—were
upon them, when those quick, mobile fingers fluttered
over their bruised bodies, they breathed
slowly and prayed. For they knew it was given
to him to do things possible to no other man. But
though many an eye warmed at sight of him,
though many an arm pleaded toward him, though
many lips trembled gratitude at his approach,
he rigidly preserved his impersonality. He had
neither smile nor jest. His eyes never warmed;
they only lighted.</p>

<p>Gretzel saw him as he entered the ward opposite
her. She shrank beneath the clothes with only her
eyes showing and studied the man. She liked his
size first of all. She had a weakling’s reverence
for physical strength. The broad shoulders, the
long, heavy arms appealed to her at once. Then
she liked his whiskers. They reminded her of pictures
of Santa Claus. Finally, she liked his deep
bass voice. It seemed to her that a man with a
voice like that must tell the truth. She wasn’t sure
of this, but the longer she listened to it and the
nearer it came, the less afraid she grew. She ventured
the tip of her nose above the bedclothes, then
her mouth, and finally her chin. By the time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
group reached her side she was facing them all, in
the open.</p>

<p>For a moment Schriftman stood over her and met
her gaze. He had never felt his soul so searched
as it was during the next few seconds. And yet
the silent questions asked of him were simple.
Gretzel sought only to know if he were a man to
tell the truth and if she could trust him with her
tender, sensitive body. She had fought the boarding-house
doctor tooth and nail from the beginning.
Not only had he lied to her but he had hurt her
brutally. Now she wished to know if she must be
on her guard with this other. So for a moment her
excited big eyes rested on his, which were like
candles burning in a frosty room. Then quite
simply and unafraid she shoved down the bedclothes
and, turning over on her face, exposed her
throbbing back.</p>

<p>Dr. Burrell caught the nurse’s eye. The latter
gave a gulpy sort of smile and turned away. With
a grunt Schriftman bent over the thin frame. His
fingers, which at times seemed endowed with five
senses, played up and down her spine, to the right,
to the left, then back again up and down. Though
at times he stopped to probe deep, he did not hurt
her much. It seemed to her that some of the
strength of his broad back ran out of his finger tips
and for a moment checked the biting ache which
had gnawed at her for a twelvemonth. Once, at a
certain spot, he made her cringe, but she understood
that this was not done intentionally.</p>

<p>Schriftman, his brow knitted, called for Burrell’s
stethoscope. He placed it over Gretzel’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
wobbly heart and listened. One of his big hands
lay on the coverlet. Suddenly he felt his thumb in
the clutch of a warm, tight grip. He found it
difficult to listen after this, for the sturdy pound of
his own heart became curiously intermingled with
this other jerky beat. Extricating his thumb, he
glared at Burrell.</p>

<p>“Transfer this patient to a private ward,” he
ordered.</p>

<p>In the luxurious seclusion of a room to herself,
with everything to eat that her fickle palate craved,
with bright-colored German picture books to look
at, with a nurse whose sole duty it was to attend
to her alone, Gretzel felt like an invalid princess.
But all these things were as nothing compared
with the joy of the frequent visits of the big doctor
himself. Had it not been for him Gretzel would
have looked with suspicion on the whole arrangement;
she would have lain awake all night worrying
about what might grow out of this. She
had learned that every sweet was only a mask of
something bitter—like her pills. Whenever anyone
had been especially nice to her at home, it was
sure to be followed by something terrible. When
her father died, her mother had brought her a doll,
and when her mother died the landlady had brought
her an apple.</p>

<p>But this was different. When she felt Schriftman’s
hand close over hers she knew that now no
more harm could come to her. He was big enough
to take quick revenge on anyone who should hurt
her. The consequent relaxation of her tense nerves
brought even some surcease of pain, so that at night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
she frequently slept two or three hours at a time.
But the best thing about these naps was the excitement
of waking up and finding this shaggy-bearded
Santa Claus by the side of her bed. It might be
eleven at night or two in the morning or four in
the morning that he came, but always he came between
the dusk and the dawn. Always his greeting
was the same:</p>

<p>“How it goes, kleine mädchen?”</p>

<p>Always she answered:</p>

<p>“I’m partickly comfy, Mister Santy.”</p>

<p>Then he would seat himself by the bed, she would
take a tight grip on his thumb, and they were off
in a jiffy to some glorious German fairyland.</p>

<p>The wonder was where the Herr Doctor found
these stories. They certainly were not in any of
his scientific treatises and he had read nothing else
for forty years.</p>

<p>If he made them up as he went along, then he
must have had more imagination than anyone ever
suspected. It was to be noted, however, that in
these stories the heroine could trace her beauty, her
charm, as well as the success of all her adventures,
to the fact that she was very particular to eat as
much as possible of whatever was brought to
her.</p>

<p>“Und so,” as he informed her one night, “if you
would be a princess, you must eat und you must
sleep. Ach—so you will become gr-ross und r-rosy
und peautiful.”</p>

<p>“Me?” Gretzel questioned doubtfully.</p>

<p>She had never been ambitious in that direction.</p>

<p>“You are peautiful already inside,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Schriftman. “It does not need much after that to
be peautiful outside—choost some fat und some
proteids.”</p>

<p>“Sum fat an’ sum protydids,” murmured Gretzel,
as though committing it to memory.</p>

<p>This was a new idea to her—this possibility of
being beautiful. For herself she didn’t care, but
if Santy wished it, then it was worth trying for.
She became a little bit jealous of these German
princesses. But a new thought disturbed her.</p>

<p>“It’s so hard to be beau-ti-ful when your back
aches you,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Ach,” replied the doctor with a frown, “dot iss
true. But when we are gr-ross und are r-rosy—so
perhaps the ache will go.”</p>

<p>Gretzel quickly searched his eyes. She had been
told before that this ache might go. It had always
been a lie. Now Santy himself had told her. On
the whole, she was sorry he had told her this.
With all her confidence in him she could not believe
that such a thing was possible. And if
it were not possible, then—he must be like the
others.</p>

<p>He had risen to go, and was bending over her as
tenderly as a mother. She reached up a thin hand
and drew down his shaggy head until her lips rested
against his ear.</p>

<p>“I’m partickly comfy,” she assured him anxiously.
“Let the ache be.”</p>

<p>He kissed her lips.</p>

<p>“Mein kleine mädchen,” he trembled. “Ach,
mein kleine mädchen.”</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the morning when he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
her, but he routed Burrell out of bed and made him
sit up until half-past four, while he discussed
everything under the face of the sun except that
which was disturbing him. Burrell, dog-tired,
listened patiently, but when Schriftman finally explained
himself, he gave a start.</p>

<p>“Dot case in Ward A,” Schriftman blurted out,
dropping into a broad dialect, as he always did
when deeply moved. “I t’ink Richards iss der
man to do dot—hein?”</p>

<p>“To do Gretzel?” exclaimed Burrell.</p>

<p>Schriftman nodded, looking up at Burrell from
beneath his wiry eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Why, doctor,” cried Burrell, “there’s just one
man in the world to do that operation—and that’s
you!”</p>

<p>Schriftman’s head sank.</p>

<p>“Richards is a great operator,” admitted Burrell,
“but he hasn’t your nerve. And, good Lord,
it’s going to take a man of iron to do that operation
without ether.”</p>

<p>Schriftman winced. Burrell ran on excitedly.</p>

<p>“Why, you yourself said she didn’t have a chance
in ten, but without you—why, it wouldn’t be a
chance in a hundred.”</p>

<p>Burrell was pleading. He was pleading with
his heart in the plea, for he was pleading for
Gretzel’s life. The operation had been the talk
of the hospital for three weeks. The girl’s heart
was too weak to stand an anesthetic, and even with
the local application of cocaine the operation was
bound to be brutal. Everyone knew there was just
one Schriftman—just one man with the brains, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
hand, and the nerve to do it. This wasn’t a task
for an ordinary surgeon; it was a task for a surgical
machine. Burrell had been waking up lately
in a cold sweat trying to find out how he could
avoid assisting. Without ether—good heavens!
there was only one Schriftman; only one man who
could keep his hand steady with Gretzel’s poor body
quivering beneath it.</p>

<p>Moreover, there wasn’t another man who had the
skill to give the lass even a show for her suffering.
Speed is what would count, and there was no such
nimble fingers in the world as Schriftman’s.</p>

<p>Burrell was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Gretzel’s life is literally in your hands, doctor,”
he exclaimed impulsively. “God give her strength
to bear the ordeal.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” muttered Schriftman.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks Gretzel seemed actually
to grow slightly plump and rosy, but almost
in the same proportion Schriftman grew wan and
pale.</p>

<p>He realized that Burrell had told the truth;
if the child was to have a fighting chance for life,
then he must do the operation. But was it possible
to make the kleine mädchen understand that
what he did he did for her own dear sake? Could
he make her realize that the hand she grasped so
confidently would not willingly cause her brutal
pain? Ach—the honest trust of those blue eyes!</p>

<p>There came a morning when Gretzel was given
no breakfast. She protested to the head nurse.</p>

<p>“Santy will be very mad on me if I don’t eat
my egg,” she declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think he will forgive you this time, dear,”
answered the nurse.</p>

<p>“Why?” Gretzel asked pointedly.</p>

<p>“Because—because—”</p>

<p>“I ain’t beau-ti-ful yet,” Gretzel interrupted
with a glance at her thin arm.</p>

<p>The nurse threw herself on her knees by the side
of the girl. She kissed that thin arm again and
again.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are beautiful and wonderful,” she
half sobbed. “Don’t ask me questions, Gretzel.
<em>Please</em> don’t ask me questions.”</p>

<p>Gretzel placed her hand on the nurse’s head.
She didn’t like to see anyone worried. And because,
here, she herself seemed always to be the
cause of worry she answered reassuringly the only
comforting thing she could think of:</p>

<p>“I’m partickly comfy.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the nurse rose swiftly and hurried
out of the room.</p>

<p>Santy favored Gretzel with an unexpected visit
this same morning. He came in shortly after the
nurse had left, and Gretzel explained to him at
once that she had not had her egg.</p>

<p>“So?” Schriftman answered nervously.</p>

<p>He seated himself on the edge of the bed. He
placed his hand firmly on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Kleine mädchen,” he faltered, “if you were
mein own kleine mädchen I could not loff you
more.”</p>

<p>She put her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Santy,” she cooed.</p>

<p>“So,” he said, “so you must neffer forget dot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew a little away from her. What he had
to say he said looking fair into her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“To-day,” he said, “we must make der ache go—poof—foreffer!”</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>“The ache,” she questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>“Foreffer,” he assured her. “Und if it hurts
you when it iss going—”</p>

<p>She smiled up into his face. She grasped his
thumb.</p>

<p>“I ain’t skeered of bein’ hurted with you, I
guess.”</p>

<p>He held his breath a moment. He couldn’t say
any more after that.</p>

<p>So it was Burrell who was forced to prepare the
maid for what was to be done. He did it as well
as he knew how, but he made a bungling job of it.
He left her gasping for breath with all the old fear
in her eyes. The thing she could not understand
was what had become of Santy. She called for
him again and again.</p>

<p>The best Burrell could think of to tell her was
that the Herr Doctor had gone to save a little girl
from death and that he would come back as soon
as he could.</p>

<p>Schriftman was depending upon the disguise of
his operating robes to prevent Gretzel from recognizing
him. But he had forgotten to reckon
with the fact that she might wonder at his apparent
desertion of her at this the gravest crisis in her
life. Burrell’s explanation did not help very much.
When they lifted her gently to the stretcher and
carried her through the corridors to the high-vaulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
amphitheatre, Santy was nowhere to be seen.
Pale, dumb, dazed, Gretzel looked everywhere for
him in vain.</p>

<p>Burrell in an ante-room assisted Schriftman into
his sterilized surplice. He adjusted the mask over
the surgeon’s beard and the white cap over his hair,
leaving only his eyes exposed. Then he helped
him into his rubber gloves. He himself was white
and loose in all his joints, but Schriftman, though
white, was like a marble statue. He was rigid and
inhumanly cold. He moved about with the quick
certainty of motion of an automaton. He gave
his orders in a voice that clicked like an instrument.
Burrell could not help admiring such self-control,
but at the same time it made him shudder.</p>

<p>When all was ready Schriftman walked noiselessly
in to the amphitheatre. Gretzel was lying
face down with an interne stationed at either side
of her head. A nurse stood ready near the glittering
array of instruments. Schriftman scarcely
breathed as he approached, but he had no sooner
reached the girl’s side than she forced up her head.
For a heartbeat she stared wildly at the sheeted
figure. Then she gave a glad, confident cry:</p>

<p>“Santy! Santy!”</p>

<p>Schriftman without replying nodded a signal,
and the internes gently forced Gretzel back again.
But Burrell slumped to the floor like an empty
grain sack and was of no more use to anyone.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours after the operation
Schriftman sat outside Gretzel’s door and received
five-minute reports on her condition. Then when
he realized that she bade fair to tide over the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
terrible shock, he returned to his lonely room and
slept. He was exhausted as he had never before
been, and when he woke up he was still exhausted.
Something seemed to have gone from him. He
made his morning hospital visit to everyone except
Gretzel, but his mind was loose and vague. So a
week passed, and they told him that while the maid
was free from pain and was making a good recovery,
she shrank from everyone who approached
her.</p>

<p>“Und she neffer asks for Santy—hein?” he questioned
the nurse.</p>

<p>The nurse lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” she admitted gently.</p>

<p>He waited another week with the success of his
wonderful operation his only consolation. There
was no doubt now but that in time Gretzel would
really be as gross and rosy as any of the princesses
he had pictured to her. For a long time yet he
must watch that weak heart, to be sure, but with
care and patience much might be done even with
that. If only she would let him, he would make
that his life work. He wanted to make her his legal
daughter; he wanted to buy a little house in the
country and take her there; he wanted to make her
a real fairyland princess.</p>

<p>“Und she neffer asks yet for Santy—hein?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the nurse.</p>

<p>“So,” he murmured, turning away his head. He
waited a moment. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“You speak somedimes off me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the nurse.</p>

<p>He did not press her further, and so she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
saved from telling him that at the mere mention
of his name the maid shrank away in terror.</p>

<p>Schriftman waited until Gretzel’s temperature
was normal—until for the first time in her life she
slept soundly through the night. He himself had
been sleeping less than one hour in the twenty-four.
His clothes hung pitifully loose about his
once firm body. As Burrell said, he was proving
the truth of his own epigram: his love was costing
him much—too much.</p>

<p>There came a day when Schriftman could stand
it no longer; when he could fight himself no longer.
He stole to the door of Gretzel’s room while she
was at breakfast. The nurse had seen him coming
and was running down the corridor as fast as she
could run. She heard the maid’s shriek of terror
and forced both hands over her ears.</p>

<p>Schriftman clutched at his heart. He grew ten
years older in a minute as he saw the girl shrink
away. She did not cry out again, but she kept her
head hidden beneath the bedclothes.</p>

<p>“Kleine mädchen,” he trembled. “Don’t do dot.
See, I vill go! I vill go und neffer again vill I
scare you!”</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>“Goot-pye, kleine mädchen!” He trembled·
“Goot-pye, leedle brincess.”</p>

<p>As he backed toward the door there was something
in his voice that made Gretzel peek out over
the bedclothes. The detail that riveted her attention
was his wasted form. He looked to her as
though he had been sick. It recalled to her all the
misery of her own long sickness—all the ache of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
those long nights now gone forever. She saw pain
written in his eyes, and she who knew so well the
horror of pain suddenly forgot in her wider sympathy
all her personal fears of the man. Her little
mother’s heart grew big with pity. With her own
ache gone and the ache in him so manifest, she felt
the stronger of the two. There was no longer any
reason why she should be afraid of him. It was
he who looked afraid.</p>

<p>She sat up in bed and studied him a moment as
he cowed away from her. Then she reached for
her egg.</p>

<p>“Santy,” she said, “come here.”</p>

<p>Like a blind man, he obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said firmly, “you mus’ eat an egg.
So you will be gross an’ rosy.”</p>

<p>Schriftman does not operate any more; he is too
busy obeying his daughter’s orders for one thing.
But he does lecture, and last year he concluded his
speech to the senior medical class with these words:
“It costs much to love, ach, yet, but—not too
much.”</p>

<h2 id="LADYBIRD">LADYBIRD</h2>

<p class="author">By Edith Barnard</p>

<p class="dropcap">It began on a very beautiful morning in early
June. The roses in the rectory garden were all
a-bloom, great white clouds were floating as near to
earth as they dared, songbirds were busy with nests
and nestlings, and the very young rector came out
of his house to enjoy it all. It had been his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
for only a few weeks; he was so young as a rector
that this was his first charge, and so young as a man
that he longed to lay aside his clerical suit and go
swimming or fishing. He was both old enough and
young enough, however, to enjoy every cloud and
blossom and song; he was far from those monotonous
years of middle life when one day is much
like another.</p>

<p>His rectory garden was, indeed, a charming one.
His parishioners had seen to that. The rectory was
new and looked old, the garden was new and looked
old; even the hedge that surrounded the garden and
churchyard was tall of growth, but had been planted
only a year or so. The church was the fashionable
house of worship for the fashionable new village—the
village just far enough out of town to make a
convenient between-season resting place for those
favored townsfolk who could spend their time as
they spent their money—pretty much as they
willed. They wanted their church and rectory to
be as beautiful and Old-World like as possible, and
they had made them so.</p>

<p>The rector was not one for whose idle hands his
arch-enemy might find mischief; he had come out to
his piazza whistling, his hands in his pockets; but he
saw at a glance that the roses bordering his front
walk would look the better for a little trimming,
and straightway he set to work. Still whistling,
busy with knife and twine, happy as a school-boy
whittling a man-o’-war, he did not notice that some
one came through the little gate, and stood quite
near, behind him.</p>

<p>A small voice said: “Good-morning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The young rector turned quickly, and beheld an
amazingly red little figure. Her frock was red, her
shoes and stockings were red, and her over-large hat
was red. She wore white kid gloves and carried a
small red cardcase. But her little face was not red;
it was white, very white, and framed in a mass of
flying black hair; her eyes were black, too, and
large and wide opened. The rector stared at the
brilliant little figure; she might have been the
picture of an elf-child, were it not for the amusing
imitations of grown-up conventionalities, the gloves
and cardcase.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” she said again, in just the same
tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon! Good-morning!” said
the rector.</p>

<p>“You are the new rector, I know,” said the child.
“I am Miss Torrington, and I’ve come to call on
your wife and daughters.”</p>

<p>The rector’s stare turned into a look of frank
amazement, even bewilderment. “My—I beg
your pardon; I’m afraid I don’t quite understand!”</p>

<p>“I’ve come to call on your wife and daughters,”
repeated the little girl. “I’m Miss Virginia Witherspoon
Torrington,” she declared convincingly,
“and I live next door to you—over there, in the
big house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see,” replied the rector. He was as
punctiliously polite as the occasion demanded, but
his mouth twitched just a little. “I’m sure I beg
your pardon. I must be very stupid. But I regret
to say that I have no wife or daughters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure you haven’t” asked Miss Torrington.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I am,” said the rector, humbly and
apologetically. “Won’t you come in and call on me
instead?”</p>

<p>Miss Torrington pondered for a moment. “I
think a gentleman ought to pay the <em>first</em> call on a
lady, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The rector bit his lip, but the child went on:
“Maggie O’Brien certainly told me there were three
ladies in the family here!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the young rector, as if he had
found something. “Why, of course, there are! I
didn’t think of that! There <em>are</em> three ladies, and
it’s very good of you to call on them. They’ll be
delighted. You see, it was your speaking of my
wife and daughters that made me forget.”</p>

<p>“What are they, then?” asked the child.</p>

<p>“One is my grandmother, and the others are my
aunts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really? I should think you’d like the grandmother
one. You know if you don’t have a grandmother
already you can’t ever get one, and you can
get a wife and daughters.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true,” acknowledged the rector. “I
suppose you haven’t a grandmother yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a father—an only father. You
know what <em>that</em> is, I suppose; only fathers are a
great deal of care. Mine needs a lot of looking
after.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” suggested the rector. “I’ll
lend you my grandmother once in a while! That is,
if you will come over and help me occasionally, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
will. I hope you’ll have the time to come. You
don’t have to look after your father every minute,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she replied. “He’s away a good deal.
But I think I ought to see her before I borrow her,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said the rector again.
“If you’ll come into the house I’ll call her, and my
aunts, too. I’m so glad you don’t mind their not
being my wife and daughters.”</p>

<p>He held open for her the door of the little parlor,
and was starting toward the stairs when Miss Torrington
called: “Oh—er—!”</p>

<p>When the rector turned toward her she said: “I’d
like to send up my cards, please. I don’t often get
a chance to use them, you know, and—”</p>

<p>The rector said, gravely: “I quite understand.
I ought to have thought of it. I never send my
own cards up to them, and I suppose that’s why
I forgot.” He was about to take them in his hand,
but Miss Torrington drew them back.</p>

<p>“Maggie O’Brien always takes them on a
silver tray. I’m very partic’lar about it at my
house.”</p>

<p>The rectory owned no silver tray, but there was a
silver butter-dish, a valued family heirloom, much
too large and fine for every-day use. It was kept
on the sideboard in the tiny dining-room. The
rector gravely brought it; Miss Torrington seemed
quite satisfied, even a little awed at its elegance, and
deposited her cards upon it.</p>

<p>That was the way her first visit began; it ended
in ginger cookies, and hugs and kisses from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the grandmother, and tremulous tears, mixed with
laughter, from the aunts. On the second visit she
went all over the little place with the rector; together
they hunted for eggs—the younger aunt
owned four hens and a rooster. They plucked delicious
red strawberries, and gathered a bunch of
red roses. There were two acres of greenhouses on
the grounds of the big house—but these were really,
truly roses, roses meant to be gathered.</p>

<p>On her third visit she made herself at home, and
from that day she owned the rectory, the grandmother,
the aunts, and the rector. In everything
but years he was as young as she, and sometimes
she was as old as he. All through the summer they
played together, for the child blossomed into rosiness,
and her father came to rely more and more
on the advice of the aunts and the borrowed grandmother
concerning her. She flitted between the two
houses, and that was the way she won her name.
The young rector would say:</p>

<p>“Come, little Ladybird, fly away home”—and
home was on either side of the hedge. The name
stayed with her always, for it suited her well—the
black-eyed little elf-child in her red frocks.</p>

<p>The second summer brought her back early,
flying through the gate into the arms of the borrowed
grandmother, hugging the aunts while they
laughed and exclaimed over her growth, and
dancing up and down before the young rector, who
was far more glad to get her back than he himself
knew. They taught each other many things that
summer—to fish and to climb trees, to say rimes
which some day might catch fairies, to throw stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
straight, and to make dolls into Indians and early
Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>One day the rector, while writing a sermon, saw
through his study window an unusual movement
in the hedge just opposite. His window opened
to the floor, so he went out of it, on tiptoe, to investigate.
Ladybird was on the ground, trying to
manage a very large saw, and scraping away with
all her might at the trunk of one of the hedge plants.
When the rector stood over her she looked up and
laughed.</p>

<p>“I wanted to surprise you, old parson,” she said.
“I’m going to cut a hole in the hedge; it takes too
long to go around by the gates!”</p>

<p>The rector remonstrated, but she had her way,
and before long there was a plainly marked path
from the gap in the hedge to the study window. It
was even more plainly marked during the third
summer, for they began to read together, and the
study held a new world for her. There were no
books at the big house, and the rectory held more
of books than of anything else, except peace and
gentleness. The next year the borrowed grandmother
was not there to welcome her, but the play
and the study went on.</p>

<p>When she was twelve she asked him the first question
concerning himself. She was sitting on the sill
of the long window, her thin little elbows on her
knees, her chin in her little claw-like hands; she was
looking at the clouds and the sunset, without seeing
either. The rector could no longer see to write, and
had come to the window to watch the glowing west.</p>

<p>Whenever she scolded him, or was very serious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
she would use his name. After a while she asked
“Mark, why do you stay in the country?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good place to stay in, isn’t it?” he answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. But father said that you had
been asked to go to St. John’s in town. He said
you were—you—Why do you stay here, Mark?”</p>

<p>The young rector stood looking over her head at
the sunset and made no reply. Ladybird looked up
at him, then out toward the west again.</p>

<p>“I know why, Mark! <em>They</em> wouldn’t like the
town.”</p>

<p>“They’ve always had the country, you know,” he
said simply. “They were so happy to come here,
and they love it.”</p>

<p>Presently he lifted her up. “Good-night, Ladybird,”
he said gaily. “Fly away home!” But she
walked slowly that night, and the rector went back
to his sermon, which was on the simple life; his
parishioners loved theories.</p>

<p>When Ladybird was fourteen, the rector found
her one day weeping over a novel. That night he
talked for hours with her father and when she came
the next day she told him, delightedly and proudly,
but just a little tearfully, that she was going to
boarding-school. For two summers she did not
come back, but at sixteen she took him again for her
confidant, telling him all about the boys, the flowers
and notes they sent, what she said in return, how
this one had mournful eyes and that one did dance
like a dream. He enjoyed it all, and teased her,
and after that there were no further breaks in their
friendship. She wrote him from time to time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
he knew all her love affairs by heart, and laughed
immoderately over them. When she was eighteen
she came back for a few weeks, and they were
weeks of delight at the rectory; she made them
love her all over again, and after she had left for
Europe the rector kept the shade of the long window
pulled down, until the grass had grown up
again on the little path through the hedge.</p>

<p>A year or two after that her father became governor
of his State, and Ladybird became Miss Torrington
indeed. She wrote long, infrequent letters
to the rector, and to the one old aunt; they heard
of her through every one, and when she came back
to open the big house for a great house-party they
saw for themselves how beautiful and charming
and gracious she was, and they guessed how many
people beside themselves loved her. Even then,
with all the house full, she would sometimes steal
off, toward sunset time, and flit through the gap
in the hedge to the rectory.</p>

<p>Then, after a year or two more, she came back
to stay longer, not in red now, but in black. The
elderly cousin who lived with her took the care of
the house, and Ladybird, in her first loneliness,
sought out her oldest friend. She made him drive
with her, walk with her, read with her, and he
obeyed her will by day and lay wakeful at night,
with aching heart and stricken conscience. They
read over the old books together, and almost all of
their talks began with: “Oh, do you remember?”
They went together very often to the grave of the
dear borrowed grandmother; Ladybird tried to
make some ginger cookies by the old recipe, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
they were not very good. They got up at dawn one
day, and went fishing again, and as in the old days
Ladybird caught all the fish, and wouldn’t take
them off the hook. Their favorite walk was along
the crest of the hill; there they could look down on
the church and the big house, and all the other
houses and their beautiful parks. From there they
could watch the sunset best, and there it was even
cooler and quieter than in the rectory garden.</p>

<p>One day they sat on the rock ledge until the red
glow of the setting sun had nearly faded. Their
talk had ceased. The man was sitting below the
girl, and she looked down at his head; there were
gray hairs here and there. Her lips trembled a
little, and she leaned over farther. The rector
looked up; he found her face close to his.</p>

<p>“Mark,” she began, but he sprang up quickly
and held out his hands:</p>

<p>“Come, little Ladybird, fly away home!” The
girl did not move.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Sit down. I want to say something
to you.”</p>

<p>He said again imperatively: “No. Come, Ladybird!
It is damp here. It is too near the clouds!”
She saw how white his face had grown, and her
own flushed; they went down without speaking.</p>

<p>After that day the rector became very busy with
parish work, and resolutely refused to take any
more walks or drives. Guests came to the big
house, and after that more guests and more. There
was one who came more often than the others, and
at the end of the summer the rector watched him
drive away with Ladybird. She had come to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
him good-by, but he had basely hidden himself
upstairs!</p>

<p>During the winter that followed the rectory
heard from her but seldom. Rumors came of her
engagement; the rumors were denied, then re-affirmed.
The old aunt declared that the child
would have written at once if they were true; the
rector made no comment. In the spring he made
some changes in his garden, and when the roses
bloomed he busied himself there more than he had
ever done before. One warm June day, while he
way tying up the swaying branches that bordered
his front walk, and thinking of the quaint little
red-frocked elf-child who had come to him there
years before, she came through the gate and up
the walk toward him, her hands outstretched, her
face all gladness and youth and beauty. “I’ve
come here first,” she cried. “I’ve come to call!”</p>

<p>They both laughed, and went in to see the old
aunt, the lapse of all the years bridged over between
them. She begged to be allowed to stay to
tea, and declared the biscuits the most delicious
that even the rectory oven had ever baked, and the
gooseberry jam as good as ever. After tea she
went, uninvited, to the rector’s study. She stood
for an instant in the doorway, looking around the
familiar room; then she looked up at the man standing
beside her, and moved toward the long window.
“Come with me to the hedge, old parson,” she
called, and before he could answer she flitted
through the window and toward the familiar gap.</p>

<p>When he reached her side he found her standing
with tightly clasped hands. She heard him come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and cried: “Oh, Mark, Mark, what is it? Who
put it there?”</p>

<p>The rector had no voice to answer her, and after
a moment of waiting she turned to him. “Did you
put that there? Did you, did you put that there?”
Still he made no answer, and with a sob she moved
off toward the gate. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ladybird, Ladybird, I <em>had</em> to! Don’t go
away like that! Ladybird—see—it is a rosebush,
a red rose, Ladybird. I tell you I had to! Virginia!”</p>

<p>But she had run through the rectory gate, and
was already on her way to the big house. For
weeks after that he did not see her. She came to
the rectory only when he was away, and again there
were guests at the big house, and again one guest
who came more frequently than all the others. The
rector came upon this young man one day, down
by the river. He was looking very unhappy indeed,
so evidently unhappy that the rector, accustomed
as he was to respond to all appeals for pity and
mercy, involuntarily stopped. The young man
held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said, and laughed a little.
“I see you know what’s up with me. I didn’t know
I was such a fool as to show it.”</p>

<p>“I ought not to have stopped,” said the rector.
“I beg your pardon.” He would have gone on,
but the boy touched his arm.</p>

<p>“Please don’t say that, sir. I’d rather have seen
you than any one else I know. In fact, I was
coming to the rectory—later. I thought perhaps
I could get you to help me out, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The rector winced a little at the boy’s deference,
but asked: “What is it?”</p>

<p>Again the other laughed, somewhat ruefully.
“Oh, I’m sure you know,” he said. “I’ve loved her
ever since my freshman year, when she was at
boarding-school. She’s never done anything else
but turn me down, but she says this has got to be
the last time. I thought if you could be persuaded
to say a word to her, sir, she might look at it differently.
She cares more for you than for any one
else, and you’ve always been like a father to her,
sir!”</p>

<p>The rector looked at the honest, boyish face, and
said: “I’ll do as you ask.”</p>

<p>Therefore, an hour later, Ladybird was standing
before him, in her own drawing-room, her cheeks
flaming with anger. “Did he ask you to come here,
or did you come of your own accord?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Both, Virginia,” answered the truthful rector
meekly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to call me Virginia,” she commanded.
“You know I hate it! If you came of
your own accord you are an interfering person, and
if you came because he told you to, you’re a—you’re
a—”</p>

<p>“The boy loves you very much, Virginia, and I
think he’d make you a good husband.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to marry him? Are you tired
of looking at me?”</p>

<p>“I think he would make you a good husband.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to see me married?”</p>

<p>The rector got up, and started for the door, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
she stood in front of him. “Was that why you
planted the rosebush in the hedge?” she asked. He
bowed before her, and she watched him grow pale.
Then she laughed, a little low, tender laugh, and—kissed
him. The rector was dimly aware of her
swift rush from the room, and of his own going
home blindly.</p>

<p>The next day he left his house early, to walk over
the hills to the home of a distant poor parishioner;
coming home late in the afternoon he came upon
her, seated on the ledge of rock upon the hillcrest.
She walked calmly to meet him, and standing
bravely before him she asked him the question. It
was then that the rector discovered that the Angel
with which he had been struggling was not, as he
had believed, the Angel of Temptation, but, indeed,
the Angel of Life. As they walked down
later, in the red glow, hand in hand, he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Ladybird, the cards on the
silver butter-dish?”</p>

<p>She laughed and said: “And those first ginger
cookies?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the day you were up in the
apple tree, Ladybird, and hit me with an apple?”</p>

<p>“And that was before I learned to ‘throw
straight,’ too!”</p>

<p>“You were very repentant, so we went fishing
the next day. You leaned over the brook to see
yourself, and your hair fell into the water.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t very long,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“How long is it now, Ladybird?” he asked.</p>

<p>She pursed up her lips. “Oh, longer,” she said.</p>

<p>At the edge of the woods they stood for a last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
look at the churchyard below. “Can you give up
the other life, Ladybird?” he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“There is no other,” she replied softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ladybird, Ladybird, when will you come
home?” he cried.</p>

<p>She shook her head at him, laughing. “Oh, parson,
old parson, you couldn’t ask one great, important
question, but you’re a genius at asking
silly ones!”</p>

<h2 id="THE_DRASNOE_PIPE-LINE">THE DRASNOE PIPE-LINE</h2>

<p class="author">By Arthur Stanwood Pier</p>

<p class="dropcap">On a windy and sullen morning in May, 1864,
a caravan of fifty wagons, each piled high
with barrels, crawled down the muddy road from
the Drasnoe oil-field. Beside the leading team of
the procession walked a one-armed man and a fifteen-year-old
boy. The faces of the two were not
cheerful. That of the man was sad; the boy’s was
anxious.</p>

<p>Behind trooped the other teamsters, shouting,
cracking their long blacksnake whips, swearing at
the horses, the mud, the threatening sky. They
were always boisterous and blasphemous during the
long daily haul.</p>

<p>The one-armed man and the boy walked together
silently by preference.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose General Grant is done fighting
by this time?” the boy asked, at last.</p>

<p>His companion smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t be done fighting for a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
many months yet. But I shouldn’t wonder if he
was out of the Wilderness by now.”</p>

<p>“It must be a big battle,” said the boy. “Most
as big as Gettysburg, don’t you think, John?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nigh.”</p>

<p>“How long do you suppose before we hear about
father—whether he’s all right?”</p>

<p>“Depends on how long the battle lasts. I guess
in a week.”</p>

<p>“That’s an awful time to wait. Your folks
didn’t hear about you till ten days after it happened,
did they?” He glanced at the empty sleeve.</p>

<p>“I believe not. But there was a good deal to
’tend to after Gettysburg. Maybe there won’t be
so much in this battle.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was down there instead of hauling oil
every day,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“You’re making more money hauling oil,” replied
the teamster. The boy glanced at him, hurt
and scornful. “Yes,” continued the man, in his
quiet voice, “you’re making quite a heap of money.
And as long as you’re doing that, what’s the good
of running off to fight? That’s what all that gang
behind us would tell you—and there’s mighty few
of them that are staying away from the war to
support their mothers.” In his quiet voice there
brimmed suddenly the full bitterness of contempt:
“Floaters—and stay-at-homes!”</p>

<p>The boy thought that perhaps John Denny was
hard on the men. At least it was not cowardice
that kept them hauling oil when they might be
shouldering rifles. The boy had seen too many evidences
of their courage and recklessness to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that; he had seen also too many rough-and-tumble
fights among them to believe that a distaste for
fighting kept them in the paths of peace. Nor
was it altogether greed for the dollars that were
being so lavishly squandered in the oil country in
those days that detained them; among them all
there was hardly one who was laying money by.</p>

<p>The boy himself, with his small farm wagon, had
earned as much as seventy dollars in a week. But
what the men earned so rapidly they spent as royally;
it was the excitement of a sudden prosperity,
greater than any they had ever expected or foreseen
and the joy of indulging it had made them
heedless of the call to arms.</p>

<p>The boy was aware that whether they liked John
Denny or not—and in view of his ill-concealed contempt
it was hard for them to like him—they
yielded him position and respect.</p>

<p>The summer before, while the armies of North
and South were battling in one corner of Pennsylvania,
in another there had sprung up excitement
over oil. John Denny had returned from Gettysburg
with his right arm shot off at the shoulder,
and had found this excitement at its height.</p>

<p>He could make a living, one-armed as he was, on
the farm. But instead, he mortgaged the place and
drilled for oil. The hole was a dry one; and Denny
faced the world in debt as well as crippled.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the great Drasnoe wells began to
flow at about that time, and teamsters were needed
to transport the oil to the railroad eight miles away.
The prices of oil and labor were high; and after
six months of hard teaming, Denny had paid off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
debt. And his fellow teamsters, who had mostly
drifted in from “outside,” yielded him grudgingly
a certain admiration. It was not diminished by the
fact that he held them all at a distance—all but the
boy, Elmer Todd, who was the youngest of the
teamsters, and whom he took under his protection.</p>

<p>At a turn in the road they saw a wagon backed
up into a field. Two men were unloading sections
of pipe. A third, a young man in high boots, such
as the teamsters wore, stood by, giving directions.
He looked up at Denny and the boy, and his face
brightened pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Morning!” he said. “We’ll get the last of our
pipe laid to-day.”</p>

<p>Denny stopped his team. “That so?” he said,
grimly. “You expect when it’s laid it will stay,
Mr. Ross?”</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes narrowed together into
a frown; his clean-cut face assumed a more determined
expression. “That’s what I expect,” he
said.</p>

<p>“There’s some talk to indicate it won’t,” said
Denny. He was in a black mood, and this young
superintendent, who was making his fortune instead
of hearing arms, came in for a share of his
contempt.</p>

<p>“When you hear any such talk, Mr. Denny, discourage
it,” said Ross. “The men won’t gain by
fighting with us over this matter.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” observed Denny, brutally, “that if you
were any good for fighting you would be elsewhere,
Mr. Ross. Get up, boys!” He cracked his whip
and walked on beside his horses.</p>

<p>“That brought the blood to his face, didn’t it?”
he said to the boy, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Beside the road and up over the rising meadows
ran a ridge of freshly turned earth. “It looks,”
said the boy, after a silence, “as if we wouldn’t
make many more trips.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Once they begin pumping oil through
that pipe-line, it’s back to the farm for you and
me. Well—teaming has been a lift for me, anyway,
this winter.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got three hundred dollars all my own,” said
the boy, proudly. “It will start me in at college
some time—when father comes home.”</p>

<p>“It’s more, I guess, than a good many have
saved up.” Denny glanced back along the line of
wagons. “And when they’re cut off from their
day’s work—I expect there will be trouble.”</p>

<p>The teamsters observed no great secrecy in expressing
their emotions and in making threats. In
consequence of specific declarations which he had
heard, at nine o’clock that night Denny was crossing
the Drasnoe oil-field, following the ridge that
denoted the pipe-line.</p>

<p>As he walked, he kept his eyes on the ridge, intent
for any sign that it had been tampered with. After
he had gone a mile he came to a strip of woods,
through which the pipe-line was laid, although at
this point the road diverged and made a circuit.</p>

<p>The woods were not more than half a mile in
area, and except for another clump of forest six
miles distant, near the railway station, made the
only secluded spot through which the pipe-line
passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The teamsters all lived in the vicinity of the
Drasnoe field.</p>

<p>“They won’t go six miles to cut pipe,” Denny
thought. “Right here’s the place to catch ’em.”</p>

<p>The sky had cleared during the afternoon; it
was a mild, clear night, with a moon that showed
the road from the edge of the woods for some distance.</p>

<p>Denny sat down on a log, lighted the lantern he
had brought, and taking a book from his pocket,
began to read.</p>

<p>Presently he looked up, and made out a figure
approaching across the fields, following the pipe-line.
He shielded the lantern and waited. When
the approaching man entered the woods he stepped
out to meet him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ross!” Denny ejaculated, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” The superintendent’s
voice was menacing.</p>

<p>“I’m constable of this borough, Mr. Ross, and
I’m here to prevent mischief.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re on the same errand.”</p>

<p>“Are we?” Denny asked. “You’d better go home
to bed, Mr. Ross. You don’t want to get mixed up
in this. You wouldn’t be any good—and it mightn’t
be good for you.”</p>

<p>“Look here, John Denny!” Ross stepped up
close; his eyes flashed in the light of the lantern
that Denny held aloft. “You the same as called
me a coward to-day, and because you’ve got only
one arm I can’t resent it! You told me that if I
was any good for fighting I’d be somewhere else
than here. Now I want you to know one thing—my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
plans were laid last week to leave for the front
next Monday. You think I haven’t wanted to go!
I don’t tell my private affairs to you or any other
man, but I’ll say this much: over in Oil City I’m
leaving a family provided for if anything happens
to me.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case,” Denny said, slowly, “I take
it back, Mr. Ross. I take everything back.”</p>

<p>They sat down together on the log and talked
amicably. Denny’s thoughts were turned back to
his war experience. He told the new recruit stories
of campaigning and battle. Ross listened with a
respect of which his maimed subordinate became
somehow conscious. That tribute of respect from
one whom he had both envied and despised, and
whom he had come so suddenly to like, swept the
bitterness from Denny’s soul.</p>

<p>“You’re giving up a good bit to go,” he said,
at last. “Old man Drasnoe likes you; you’ve got
a start toward being a millionaire. You throw it
all up and go off to the war—and you can’t tell
what you may come back to.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to run my chance,” Ross answered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drasnoe satisfied to have you leave?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Ross, quietly, “Mr. Drasnoe
is quite satisfied. He likes the man I’ve picked to
take my place.” Denny’s interest was at once
awakened.</p>

<p>“And who might that be?”</p>

<p>Ross hesitated. “It’s hardly time to talk about
it yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. I wasn’t meaning to pry.”</p>

<p>They arranged to divide the night into watches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Denny was to sleep until twelve, then Ross would
rouse him and sleep till four.</p>

<p>At about one o’clock, while Ross, lying at the
foot of a tree, was sleeping, the marauders came.
Denny saw them as they climbed over the fence by
the roadside. He awakened Ross, and said:</p>

<p>“They’re coming. You’d better leave this to me—as
constable. If they see you, they’ll get ugly.
You go in behind that thicket and wait.”</p>

<p>Ross protested. “You can come out if you’re
needed,” Denny said; and the superintendent reluctantly
withdrew. Denny put out his lantern,
and stepping behind a great oak, awaited the approach.</p>

<p>There were a dozen men, carrying lanterns, mattocks
and spades; they passed close by where
Denny stood.</p>

<p>“Spread out, now—and rip it up all along!” cried
one; and he lifted his mattock and brought it down
upon the earth.</p>

<p>Denny stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “hold on!”</p>

<p>They faced him, startled. The one who had
spoken caught up a lantern and turned it on him.</p>

<p>“Denny!” he exclaimed. “Spyin’ on us!”</p>

<p>“I’m borough constable,” said Denny. “Destroying
property has a penalty attached.” The
men crowded round him, disturbed, angry, threatening.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are!” said the leader, scornfully.
“Arrest us.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any arrests if there’s no damage
done, O’Brien,” Denny answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>O’Brien turned and struck his mattock into the
earth. “Show him a little damage, boys,” he
urged. “Yank up the pipe.”</p>

<p>The others set to work, cursing at Denny meanwhile.
The dirt flew; they flung it jeeringly at
him.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Denny. “You are twelve men
against one. Maybe I can’t arrest you to-night,
but I’ve got your names.”</p>

<p>In a few moments they had exposed the pipe,
which was not buried deep. Then O’Brien knelt
and sawed it through in two places, and cast the
section at Denny’s feet.</p>

<p>“There!” he said. “How d’ye like the looks of
that, Mr. Constable? And now, so’s you won’t follow
us and see where else we operate, we’ll just tie
you up for a while.”</p>

<p>“You fellows will be piling up trouble for yourselves,”
Denny warned them. “Murphy and Conway,
there—you ought to have more sense.”</p>

<p>One of these two men, Murphy, spoke in a low
voice, unwillingly:</p>

<p>“I guess maybe we’d better quit. If he reports
us—”</p>

<p>“He ain’t going to report us!” interrupted
O’Brien. “He don’t dare. Come, boys, get
a-hold of him, and we’ll tie him up—”</p>

<p>He advanced a step toward Denny, and in the
same instant Denny drew a revolver and leveled it
at O’Brien’s head.</p>

<p>“Don’t lay a hand on me,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Get behind him and grab him, somebody!”
shouted O’Brien. “Spread out and get round him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>But the men hesitated. “I said we’d ought to
have wore masks!” muttered one. “He’s seen us
all now.”</p>

<p>O’Brien made a quick dash, trying to circle
Denny, who whirled and held the revolver pointed
at O’Brien’s face.</p>

<p>“Jump on him now!” shouted O’Brien; and then
one, bolder than the others, sprang upon Denny’s
shoulders and bore him to the ground. O’Brien
was instantly upon him also, got possession of his
revolver, and then with breathless imprecations began
winding a rope about his ankles.</p>

<p>“All right!” muttered Denny. “You’ve got me—but
you fellows will pay for this.”</p>

<p>Then Ross walked into the midst of the group.
The leader of the gang looked up from where he
knelt. “It’s you, is it?” he said, defiantly.</p>

<p>Ross turned from him to the others.</p>

<p>“Will you give me five minutes?” he asked. “I’m
in your power; I’m all alone. Will you let me have
five minutes to talk?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“Just five minutes, mind,” said O’Brien, truculently.
He tightened the rope that bound Denny’s
arm behind his back and stood up.</p>

<p>“When I came here to-night,” Ross began, persuasively,
“it was with the idea that there might be
some trouble over this pipe-line. But though I was
expecting trouble, there was only one man that I
looked on as my personal enemy, and that was John
Denny. He called me a coward to my face this
morning; and when I came here a couple of hours
ago, and found him on duty as constable, I felt I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
found more trouble than I was looking for. Well,
we talked the whole matter out—and came to an
understanding. And maybe, after talking this
other matter out, you and I can come to an understanding.</p>

<p>“Here’s the situation. A pump and a pipe together
are going to do for almost nothing more
than all you men have been in the habit of doing
for a good deal of money. They’re going to put
you out of business. So you get together and decide
to put the pipe out of business. And you mean
to keep putting it out of business just as often as
it resumes. Isn’t that stating the case.”</p>

<p>Two or three of the men laughed uneasily; there
was no dissent.</p>

<p>“Now you can do that to-night; you can keep on
doing it for a while. But you must see—your common
sense must tell you—that when an economical
way of doing a thing is discovered, the expensive
way has got to be abandoned. They are to have
a pipe-line over in the Deepwater valley, and the
teamsters will have to quit; they are to have another
up at Anderson, and the teamsters will have
to quit; they’re putting pipe-lines in everywhere.
It’s a fact you’ve got to face; the day of the teamster
in the oil regions is over.</p>

<p>“Just to make it practical—to demonstrate it,
not to make threats—listen. You cut this pipe to-night.
What happens? There are two witnesses
against you—John Denny and myself. All that
the law requires is two witnesses. It’s true you
have us in your power to-night—but I hardly
think any of you mean to do murder in cold blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
You may think of keeping us out of the way for
a while—maybe using force on us to make us hold
our tongues. But some time you’ll have to let us
go free—and I expect we will go free without
making any promises.”</p>

<p>He spoke these words with slow distinctness and
emphasis; there was an uneasy stirring in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” Ross continued, “before I started
out to-night I left a note at home, saying where I
was going and why. If I should mysteriously disappear,
that note will afford a clue. You may all
feel that you’re strong enough to defy the law and
destroy property and commit violence. But even
supposing this is true—what can you gain by it?
Do you think the company whose pipe you cut
will ever again employ you to drive its wagons?
Drasnoe would rather let his oil forever run to
waste than be coerced into letting you handle it.
And you can’t so easily carry matters with a high
hand—”</p>

<p>“You begin to threaten us!” cried O’Brien.
“We’ve had enough—”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to threaten,” Ross replied. “I’m
just trying to make a complete statement of the
case. In a moment I’ll talk in a way that you
can’t regard as threatening. But as to your being
able to override the law—you know, of course,
what will happen. The company will spend its
last cent fighting for its rights. It will hire men
to protect its property. The community will be
roused against you. You’ll have to fight with the
company’s watchmen; you can’t go on cutting its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pipe with impunity. And meanwhile you’ll be
blacklisted by the company, whereas, if you accept
this overturn in a peaceful spirit, the company will
try to give work of some kind to as many of you as
want it. Now I’ve come to the end of everything
that may sound threatening. Are you willing I
should go on for a few moments longer?”</p>

<p>“No,” shouted O’Brien. But “Yes!” cried the
others; and some of them turned to O’Brien and
bade him be still.</p>

<p>“I want you to know that last week I tendered
my resignation as superintendent, to take effect
next Monday. Next Monday I start for Virginia,
to join Grant’s army. It’s just occurred to me that
that would be a pretty good thing for those of you
to do who are out of a job and so have a hankering
to fight somebody.” He spoke the words with a
smile; by the lantern-light he could see the smile
reflected on the face of some of the men. “I hope
you’ll think better of fighting the company—for if
you don’t, I’ll have to stay here and deprive General
Grant of my services.” This time the smile
on his face was echoed by a murmur of laughter.
“I’d be mighty glad if those of you who feel bound
to fight somebody would join me next Monday and
start for the Wilderness. I don’t know that it
would be any more of a fight than you’d get by
staying here and tackling the company—but I
guess it would be enough. That’s all I have to say;
and now if you think the only thing is to string me
up on one of those trees, I can’t help myself.”</p>

<p>“I guess there won’t be any lynching!” muttered
one of the men; from the others there issued only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sheepish, uncomfortable laughter. O’Brien was
silent.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Murphy, at last. “I don’t know
but I may join your soldier squad on Monday,
captain. Looks like things will be kind of quiet
round here for a full-grown fightin’ man.”</p>

<p>At this there was loud laughter, and Ross knew
that he had won.</p>

<p>“You think, Mr. Ross,” said a man, hesitatingly,
“if a fellow was to stay, the company might find
him a job?”</p>

<p>“I think so. That will be one of the problems
for my successor—who, by the way, is lying there
with his feet tied.”</p>

<p>The men gazed at one another; Denny lay
speechless and amazed. Then one of the men
turned to O’Brien.</p>

<p>“O’Brien,” he said, gravely, “if you and me are
looking for jobs, suppose we untie his feet.”</p>

<p>At eight o’clock on Monday morning there
waited at the railway station a group of ten men,
who were starting South to join Grant’s army.
Among them was one whom the others half jestingly,
yet half-seriously also, called “Captain.” He
stepped apart from the rest to speak to a one-armed
man and a boy who had just driven up to the platform.
The sound of the approaching train made
itself heard.</p>

<p>“You’ll be sure to see father for me, won’t you,
Mr. Ross?” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Sure. I’m glad you had word he was all right.
I’ll send you a letter as soon as I see him—and I’ll
tell him all about you. Good-by, Elmer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to the one-armed man.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Denny!”</p>

<p>The train rushed along the platform as Denny
gripped Ross’s hand.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Ross—thank you—” His voice
broke, but he regained it. “Come back to us—and
come back—<em>whole</em>!”</p>

<p>Then, amid the cheers of the few who had gathered
to see the departure, the recruits boarded the
train, and the train pulled away.</p>

<p>“He <em>will</em> come back!” said Denny to Elmer, with
conviction. “Even if the whole of Lee’s army lays
a trap for him, he’ll come back.”</p>

<h2 id="MANUK_DEL_MONTE">MANUK DEL MONTE</h2>

<p class="author">By Rowland Thomas</p>

<p class="dropcap">Early one morning, just before the dawn,
three of us were riding wearily down the slope
of one of the great grassy hills—some people call
them mountains—which lie between the provinces
of Isabella and Nueva Vizcaya.</p>

<p>We had been travelling all night by moonlight,
and now as the east was growing rosy we were
winding down to a little wood in the valley, where
we hoped to find a mountain stream to give us water
for our breakfast, and a thing of far more importance,
grazing for the horses, for it was the dry season,
and the grass on the hills was parched and dead.
The breakfast swung with mocking lightness behind
Justin’s saddle, merely a few handfuls of cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
rice rolled in the butt of a banana leaf. It was
also tiffin and dinner, for we were travelling light
and fast, and carried not even chocolate, nothing
but the rice.</p>

<p>I was watching the gyrations of the breakfast
moodily, for I was sleepy and hungry and sore,
when suddenly from the wood below us the crow
of a cock rang out, shrill and triumphant. I was
surprised, for few people live along a trail used
mostly by bandits and head-hunters.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the slope of a farther hill the call
rang out again, and then the whole wood echoed
with the sounds of the farmyard.</p>

<p>“What town is this?” I asked the boys, although
we were at least a day’s journey from any settlement
which I knew.</p>

<p>Justin laughed, and even Tranquid smiled stiffly.</p>

<p>“It is no town, señor,” said Justin. “It is the
<i lang="es">manuk del monte</i>—the wild chicken—which you
hear.”</p>

<p>After saddles were off and the horses’ backs were
washed, the animals rolled and grazed luxuriously
by the swift, clear stream, and Tranquid, prince of
servants, dexterously unrolled the breakfast.</p>

<p>He laid stones on the corners of the leaf, and
patted the snowy mass of rice out smoothly, and
filled a bamboo drinking-cup from the brook, while
I pretended not to see. At meal-times Tranquid
has a solemn and important air worthy of the most
autocratic of London butlers, and I am a babe in
his hands.</p>

<p>“Breakfast is served, señor,” said Tranquid,
gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“I come,” I replied, with equal gravity, and
rolled over twice and came up on my knees, Japanese
fashion, beside my lowly table.</p>

<p>Just as I was going to plunge my fingers into
the rice, a cock crowed loud and clear among the
trees close at hand. A great ferocity of meat
hunger swept over me.</p>

<p>“Give me the boom-boom, Justin!” I commanded.
“We will have manuk del monte for breakfast.”</p>

<p>The cock crowed often while I stole through the
undergrowth, as softly as the ferns and bristly
creepers would let me.</p>

<p>As I drew near, the crowing ceased, and I was
peering about the brush and shrub for a sight of the
cock when—<em>whir</em>! From the lower branches of a
tree, fifty feet above my head, a splendid bird shot
out with a boom like a partridge and sailed away
between the tree trunks, a dazzling vision of white
and green and gold.</p>

<p>I was too startled to shoot, for I had never before
seen chickens that roost like eagles and flew like
pheasants and were as brilliant as humming-birds.</p>

<p>In a moment I heard his strong wings beating on
the other side of the valley, and I went back and ate
my rice quietly.</p>

<p>That incident began my acquaintance with the
wild chickens, and they soon grew to be a very dear
part of the forest life, bringing me an odd mixture
of pleasant memory and homesickness as I listened
to them.</p>

<p>We heard them always when we made and left
our one-night homes along the trail. The cocks
proved to be just as exacting husbands as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
domesticated cousins, crowing their families home and
abroad with fussy punctuality.</p>

<p>If a gay young cockerel or a giddy pullet lingered
too long afield, the lord of the flock grew
noisy with anxiety as the sunset faded. With the
dawn he woke, brisk and important, and woe betide
the sleepyhead of the family.</p>

<p>There was no “Rouse up, sweet slugabed” for
him, but an ear-splitting call, and we often chuckled
at thought of the sheepish haste of the laggard when
that sound penetrated to his sleepy brain.</p>

<p>A tropical forest is a thing of awe and mystery,
with its eternal dim twilight and tangled creepers,
and innumerable dark vistas which hide inhabitants
one seldom hears and never sees. Most of the creatures
seem to feel the silent immensity and vagueness
as a man does, and seek safety in unobtrusiveness.</p>

<p>These brave, cheery birds alone were unaffected
by it, and they crowed and cackled and clucked
about their business of living as carelessly as if there
were no such thing as fear in the world.</p>

<p>Yet with all their independence they showed a
baffling shyness, and many weeks went by before I
caught more than a distant glimpse of one.</p>

<p>Tranquid hunted them with painful devotion.
But he was a child of the cities, lost in the mountains
as a puppy would have been. When a cock
crowed near a camping-place, his face would brighten
hopefully, and he would go creeping off with the
noiselessness of a young elephant. Back and forth
he crashed in the brush, pulling branches aside with
excessive caution and peeping behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the bird would flush from a tree and shoot
away in a blur of colored light. Then Tranquid
would straighten up with a nervous jerk, and cry
triumphantly:</p>

<p>“There, señor, I have found him! There he goes.
Look! Look!” pointing up to the tree where he
had been.</p>

<p>On these occasions Justin always lay on the
grass and laughed.</p>

<p>Justin was a woodland philosopher, and had discovered
that town-bred folk and wild chickens had
been sent into the world for his amusement. He
never deigned to take any further part in the
pursuit.</p>

<p>When it came to stalking a deer or running down
a pig he was all eagerness and skill, and would lead
me for hours without a thought of rest, but chickens
were beneath him. Occasionally, however, as we
rode along, a crow would caw somewhere above us.
Then Justin was full of excitement.</p>

<p>“Look, señor!” he would shout, pointing up to
the empty sky. “I have found him. There!
There!”</p>

<p>In spite of Justin’s jesting, my desire to see a
wild cock face to face only increased with repeated
failure.</p>

<p>I never tried to shoot one after that first experience.
I would as soon have thought of shooting at
a monkey. But I wanted to have one for my own,
to look at, and draw pictures of, and show to my
poor friends who lived down in the plains through
the hot season, and complained of prickly heat. I
even dreamed of presenting one to my friend, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
captain, and letting him create a new and lusty race
of fowls, a breed which would meet the hawk in
his own element, and laugh at woven-wire fences.</p>

<p>At last, up in a little mountain village, my opportunity
came. Tranquid announced, with the respectful
elation he sometimes permitted himself,
that a man had a wild rooster. Would the señor
like to come to see it?</p>

<p>The señor was willing, so we went down the narrow
grass-grown street together, stepping carefully
over the babies and pigs that were basking in the
sun.</p>

<p>In the yard of a little tumble-down shack we
found a rusty brown bird tied to a post by a bit of
twine about his leg. The old man, his owner,
scattered a few kernels of corn, and the poor dingy
thing pecked at them in a half-hearted way. A hen
came bustling up and he pecked peevishly at her
once or twice, and then hopped back to his post
and stood there, dull and round-shouldered, like a
sulky boy who had decided that the corn was not
of much importance, anyway, and had put his hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p>I was slow to believe that this could be a brother
of the swift, bright bird which had boomed out of
a treetop that first morning, but I presently discovered
that it was. The long, slender body, the
powerful wings, the sharp, heavy bill, were the
product of generations of wild life. And under
the dust and rustiness of the feathers there were
still traces of the green and gold of the forest. The
changes were due only to a changed mode of life.</p>

<p>“The man says,” explained Tranquid, “that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
has had this rooster for a long time, and it is dirty.
He says he will catch a clean one for the señor, if
he pleases.”</p>

<p>Of course the señor pleased; and one bright
morning we set out. The old man, our guide,
marched in front, most importantly, for it is not
every day that one has a chance to show a señor
what a clever man one is at catching wild chickens,
and the old man knew that his grandchildren would
tell their children about this expedition.</p>

<p>Under his arm he carried a red fighting cock. It
struck me as a bit odd to carry such an animal on
a hunting trip, but I asked no questions. One feels
no surprise in the Philippines in meeting people
with roosters under their arms; it is quite the usual
thing. Tranquid followed the old man, respectfully
hopeful. Then came Justin, smiling, and I
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>A mile or so from the village the wall of the forest
rose, dark and impenetrable. But at one point a
stream came down from the hills, and there the
field extended into the woods for a little way, making
a sort of room, cool and shadowy, and carpeted
with short, thick turf.</p>

<p>Here the old man halted, and waited till we
all stood about him. Then he drew from the pocket
of his blouse a bundle of twine, wound on four
pointed sticks. Justin stopped smiling. Anything
in the nature of a trap, anything which matched
man’s wits against the instinct of the wild creatures,
interested Justin.</p>

<p>The old man chose a spot of level ground and
set to work. He drove one of the little stakes into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the ground, uncoiled the twine, drove another, and
so on, until he had marked out a square, about a
yard on a side. On three sides the twine was carried
on the stakes a few inches above the ground,
and from this fence, every hand’s breadth or so,
hung a little noose of fiber.</p>

<p>The fourth side of the square was a wall of
brush, and at the center of this the old man now
drove a fifth stake, and tied his fighting cock to it
by a very short tether. Then he opened all the
little nooses and spread them carefully on the
ground within the square. Justin inspected the
work.</p>

<p>“It is very good,” he announced at last. “One
would not believe that this old man could be so
wise. The wild rooster hears this one. He wishes
to fight. All roosters wish to fight always. He
comes from the wood, dancing, so! This one
crows and fluffs out his feathers, so! The wild
rooster comes to the little fence and they look at
each other, so!” said Justin, using Tranquid for
illustration. “He cannot pass under the little fence;
it is too low. He cannot step over it; it is too
high. He hops, so! His foot falls in the noose,
and—so!” said Justin, dancing on one foot and
cackling shrilly. “<i>Abáa.</i> It is very good. The
old man is much wiser than one would think to
look at him.”</p>

<p>The old man listened to this monologue with
disgust.</p>

<p>“Now we shall go and be very quiet. The manuk
del monte does not like noisy ones,” he said, glancing
at Justin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>So we went and sat down where some bushes
screened us and yet left us a view of the trap.
After half an hour Justin curled up and went to
sleep. The breeze was cool and the grass was soft,
and soon I followed his example.</p>

<p>I was awakened by a bell-like call from the forest.
The captive rooster was dancing at his stake.
Presently he flapped his wings and stood on tiptoe
and answered scornfully. They challenged back
and forth till at last, with a boom of wings, the wild
cock, the very one I had been dreaming of, dropped
on the grass.</p>

<p>As he caught sight of the traitor he spread all
his splendid plumage and crowed again. And the
red bird answered bravely. After all, it was not
his fault that he was a traitor.</p>

<p>The wild bird ran forward with a swift, steady
gait very unlike the awkward stride of his tame
cousins, and lowered his head, and spread his ruff.
Then he stood up straight and scratched sticks and
grass into the air with a sturdy leg and crowed.
The traitor kicked furiously at his tether, but it
held, and the wild cock advanced to the fence.</p>

<p>For a moment the two looked at each other with
lowered heads, and then they sprang. The traitor,
of course, collapsed in an ignominious heap. As
the wild cock landed inside the fence, his foot barely
touched the ground. But the touch was enough.
One of the little nooses tightened about his legs,
and as he sprang again he, too, came down with a
jerk.</p>

<p>The birds were rising to face each other when
we ran forward, and he turned toward us at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
noise. I expected to see him struggle madly to
escape. But the brave little fellow faced us, and
flapped his wings and stretched his neck, challenging
us fearlessly. In a moment the old man had
tossed a handkerchief over his head and loosened
the noose, and I held him between my hands.</p>

<p>I could feel the little muscles taut as steel wires
beneath my fingers, and the heart beating furiously,
but he made no sound and did not struggle.
I looked at the lustrous markings of his back and
wings, and the long, drooping tail-feathers, and
then all at once came a picture of the draggled,
spiritless captive back in the old man’s yard. I
plucked away the handkerchief and tossed him into
the air.</p>

<p>His wings beat very loud in the stillness, and
we all started. Then I looked round sheepishly.
Tranquid was staring up stupidly, with his mouth
in a big, round O. Justin was laughing, but suddenly
he pointed excitedly to Tranquid’s mouth
and shouted:</p>

<p>“Look, señor! I have found him. There he
goes. Look! Look!” And it would be hard to
say whether the old man gazed at Justin or at me
with the deeper disgust.</p>

<h2 id="THE_MAN_WITHOUT_A_COUNTRY">THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY</h2>

<p class="author">By Edward Everett Hale</p>

<p class="dropcap">I suppose that very few casual readers of the
<cite>New York Herald</cite> of August 18th observed
in an obscure corner among the “Deaths,” the announcement—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Nolan.</span> Died, on board U. S. Corvette Levant, Lat. 2° 11´
S., Long. 131° W., on the 11th of May, <span class="smcap">Philip Nolan</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>I happened to observe it, because I was
stranded at the old Mission-House in Makinaw,
waiting for a Lake Superior steamer which did not
choose to come, and I was devouring to the very
stubble all the current literature I could get hold
of, even down to the deaths and marriages in the
<cite>Herald</cite>. My memory for names and people is
good, and the reader will see, as he goes on, that
I had reason enough to remember Philip Nolan.
There are hundreds of readers who would have
paused at that announcement, if the officer of the
<i>Levant</i> who reported it had chosen to make it thus:—“Died,
May 11th, <span class="smcap">The Man without a Country</span>.”
For it was as “The Man without a Country”
that poor Philip Nolan had generally been known
by the officers who had him in charge during some
fifty years, as, indeed, by all men who sailed under
them. I dare say there is many a man who has
taken wine with him once a fortnight, in a three
years’ cruise, who never knew that his name was
“Nolan,” or whether the poor wretch had any name
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>There can now be no possible harm in telling
this poor creature’s story. Reason enough there
has been till now, ever since Madison’s administration
went out in 1817, for very strict secrecy, the
secrecy of honor itself, among the gentlemen of the
navy who have had Nolan in successive charge.
And certainly it speaks well for the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
of the profession, and the personal honor of its
members, that to the press this man’s story has
been wholly unknown—and, I think, to the country
at large also. I have reason to think, from
some investigations I made in the Naval Archives
when I was attached to the Bureau of Construction,
that every official report relating to him was
burned when Ross burned the public buildings at
Washington. One of the Tuckers, or possibly one
of the Watsons, had Nolan in charge at the end
of the war; and when, on returning from his cruise,
he reported at Washington to one of the Crowninshields—who
was in the Navy Department when
he came home—he found that the Department ignored
the whole business. Whether they really
knew nothing about it or whether it was a “<i lang="it">Non mi
ricordo</i>” determined on as a piece of policy, I do
not know.</p>

<p>But this I do know, that since 1817, and possibly
before, no naval officer has mentioned Nolan
in his report of a cruise.</p>

<p>But, as I say, there is no need for secrecy any
longer. And now the poor creature is dead, it
seems to me worth while to tell a little of his story,
by way of showing young Americans of to-day what
it is to be <span class="smcap">A Man without a Country</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip Nolan was as fine a young officer as there
was in the “Legion of the West,” as the Western
division of our army was then called. When Aaron
Burr made his first dashing expedition down to
New Orleans in 1805, at Fort Massac, or somewhere
above on the river, he met, as the Devil
would have it, this gay, dashing, bright young fellow,
at some dinner-party, I think. Burr marked
him, talked to him, walked with him, took him a
day or two’s voyage in his flat-boat, and, in short,
fascinated him. For the next year, barrack-life
was very tame to poor Nolan. He occasionally
availed himself of the permission the great man had
given him to write to him. Long, high-worded,
stilted letters the poor boy wrote and rewrote and
copied. But never a line did he have in reply from
the gay deceiver. The other boys in the garrison
sneered at him, because he sacrificed in this unrequited
affection for a politician the time which
they devoted to Monongahela, hazard, and high-low-jack.
Bourbon, euchre, and poker were still
unknown. But one day Nolan had his revenge.
This time Burr came down the river not as an attorney
seeking a place for his office, but as a disguised
conqueror. He had defeated I know not
how many district-attorneys; he had dined at I
know not how many public dinners; he had been
heralded in I know not how many <cite>Weekly Arguses</cite>,
and it was rumored that he had an army behind him
and an empire before him. It was a great day—his
arrival—to poor Nolan. Burr had not been at the
fort an hour before he sent for him. That evening
he asked Nolan to take him out in his skiff, to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
him a canebrake or a cottonwood tree, as he said,—really
to seduce him; and by the time the sail was
over, Nolan was enlisted body and soul. From
that time, though he did not yet know it, he lived
as <span class="smcap">A Man without a Country</span>.</p>

<p>What Burr meant to do I know no more than
you, dear reader. It is none of our business just
now. Only, when the grand catastrophe came, and
Jefferson and the House of Virginia of that day
undertook to break on the wheel all the possible
Clarences of the then House of York, by the great
treason-trial at Richmond, some of the lesser fry
in that distant Mississippi Valley, which was
farther from us than Puget’s Sound is to-day, introduced
the like novelty on their provincial stage,
and, to while away the monotony of the summer at
Fort Adams, got up, for <em>spectacles</em>, a string of
court-martials on the officers there. One and another
of the colonels and majors were tried, and,
to fill out the list, little Nolan, against whom,
Heaven knows, there was evidence enough,—that
he was sick of the service, had been willing to be
false to it, and would have obeyed any order to
march any-whither with any one who would follow
him had the order been signed, “By command of
His Exc. A. Burr.” The courts dragged on. The
big flies escaped,—rightly for all I know. Nolan
was proved guilty enough, as I say; yet you and
I would never have heard of him, reader, but that,
when the president of the court asked him at the
close, whether he wished to say anything to show
that he had always been faithful to the United
States, he cried out, in, a fit of frenzy,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“D—n the United States! I wish I may never
hear of the United States again!”</p>

<p>I suppose he did not know how the words shocked
old Colonel Morgan, who was holding the court.
Half the officers who sat in it had served through
the Revolution, and their lives, not to say their
necks, had been risked for the very idea which he
so cavalierly cursed in his madness. He, on his
part, had grown up in the West of those days, in
the midst of “Spanish plot,” “Orleans plot,” and all
the rest. He had been educated on a plantation
where the finest company was a Spanish officer or a
French merchant from Orleans. His education,
such as it was, had been perfected in commercial
expeditions to Vera Cruz, and I think he told me
his father once hired an Englishman to be a private
tutor for a winter on the plantation. He had spent
half his youth with an older brother, hunting horses
in Texas; and, in a word, to him “United States”
was scarcely a reality. Yet he had been fed by
“United States” for all the years since he had been
in the army. He had sworn on his faith as a Christian
to be true to “United States.” It was “United
States” which gave him the uniform he wore, and
the sword by his side. Nay, my poor Nolan, it was
only because “United States” had picked you out
first as one of her own confidential men of honor
that “A. Burr” cared for you a straw more than
for the flat-boat men who sailed his ark for him. I
do not excuse Nolan; I only explain to the reader
why he damned his country, and wished he might
never hear her name again.</p>

<p>He never did hear her name but once again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
From that moment, September 23, 1807, till the
day he died, May 11, 1863, he never heard the name
again. For that half century and more he was a
man without a country.</p>

<p>Old Morgan, as I said, was terribly shocked. If
Nolan had compared George Washington to Benedict
Arnold, or had cried, “God save King George,”
Morgan would not have felt worse.</p>

<p>He called the court into his private room, and
returned in fifteen minutes, with a face like a sheet,
to say,—</p>

<p>“Prisoner, hear the sentence of the court! The
court decides, subject to the approval of the President,
that you never hear the name of the United
States again.”</p>

<p>Nolan laughed. But nobody else laughed. Old
Morgan was too solemn, and the whole room was
hushed dead as night for a minute. Even Nolan
lost his swagger in a moment. Then Morgan
added,—</p>

<p>“Mr. Marshal, take the prisoner to Orleans in
an armed boat, and deliver him to the naval commander
there.”</p>

<p>The marshal gave his orders and the prisoner was
taken out of court.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marshal,” continued old Morgan, “see that
no one mentions the United States to the prisoner.
Mr. Marshal, make my respects to Lieutenant
Mitchell at Orleans, and request him to order that
no one shall mention the United States to the prisoner
while he is on board ship. You will receive
your written orders from the officer on duty here
this evening. The court is adjourned without day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>I have always supposed that Colonel Morgan
himself took the proceedings of the court to Washington
City, and explained them to Mr. Jefferson.
Certain it is that the President approved them—certain,
that is, if I may believe the men who say
they have seen his signature. Before the <i>Nautilus</i>
got round from New Orleans to the Northern Atlantic
coast with the prisoner on board the sentence
had been approved, and he was a man without a
country.</p>

<p>The plan then adopted was substantially the
same which was necessarily followed ever after.
Perhaps it was suggested by the necessity of sending
him by water from Fort Adams and Orleans.
The Secretary of the Navy—it must have been the
first Crowninshield, though he is a man I do not remember—was
requested to put Nolan on board a
government vessel bound on a long cruise, and to
direct that he should be only so far confined there
as to make it certain that he never saw or heard of
the country. We had few long cruises then, and
the navy was very much out of favor; and as almost
all of this story is traditional, as I have explained,
I do not know certainly what his first cruise was.
But the commander to whom he was intrusted—perhaps
it was Tingey or Shaw, though I think it
was one of the younger men—we are all old enough
now—regulated the etiquette and the precautions
of the affair, and according to his scheme they were
carried out, I suppose, till Nolan died.</p>

<p>When I was second officer of the <i>Intrepid</i>, some
thirty years after, I saw the original paper of instructions.
I have been sorry ever since that I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
not copy the whole of it. It ran, however, much in
this way:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span> (with a date, which
must have been late in 1807).</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>—You will receive from Lieutenant Neale
the person of Philip Nolan, late a Lieutenant in
the United States Army.</p>

<p>“This person on his trial by court-martial ‘expressed
with an oath the wish that he might never
hear of the United States again.’</p>

<p>“The court sentenced him to have his wish fulfilled.</p>

<p>“For the present, the execution of the order is intrusted
by the President to this Department.</p>

<p>“You will take the prisoner on board your ship
and keep him there with such precautions as shall
prevent his escape.</p>

<p>“You will provide him with such quarters, rations,
and clothing as would be proper for an officer of his
late rank, if he were a passenger on your vessel on
the business of his government.</p>

<p>“The gentlemen on board will make any arrangements
agreeable to themselves regarding his society.
He is to be exposed to no indignity of any
kind, nor is he ever unnecessarily to be reminded
that he is a prisoner.</p>

<p>“But under no circumstances is he ever to hear
of his country or to see any information regarding
it; and you will specially caution all the officers
under your command to take care, that, in the various
indulgences which may be granted, this rule,
in which his punishment is involved, shall not be
broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the intention of the government that he
shall never again see the country which he has disowned.
Before the end of your cruise you will receive
orders which will give effect to this intention.</p>

<p class="center">“Respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">W. Southward</span>,<br />
“For the Secretary of the Navy.”</p>

</div>

<p>If I had only preserved the whole of this paper,
there would be no break in the beginning of my
sketch of this story. For Captain Shaw, if it were
he, handed it to his successor in the charge, and he
to his, and I suppose the commander of the <i>Levant</i>
has it to-day as his authority for keeping this man
in this mild custody.</p>

<p>The rule adopted on board the ships on which I
have met “the man without a country” was, I think,
transmitted from the beginning. No mess liked
to have him permanently, because his presence cut
off all talk of home or of the prospect of return, of
politics or letters, of peace or of war,—cut off more
than half the talk men liked to have at sea. But it
was always thought too hard that he should never
meet the rest of us, except to touch hats, and we
finally sank into one system. He was not permitted
to talk with the men, unless an officer was by. With
officers he had unrestrained intercourse, as far as
they and he chose. But he grew shy, though he
had favorites: I was one. Then the captain always
asked him to dinner on Monday. Every mess
in succession took up the invitation in its turn.
According to the size of the ship, you had him at
your mess more or less often at dinner. His breakfast
he ate in his own state-room—he always had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
state-room,—which was where a sentinel or somebody
on the watch could see the door. And whatever
else he ate or drank, he ate or drank alone.
Sometimes, when the marines or sailors had any
special jollification, they were permitted to invite
“Plain Buttons,” as they called him. Then Nolan
was sent with some officer, and the men were forbidden
to speak of home while he was there. I
believe the theory was that the sight of his punishment
did them good. They called him “Plain Buttons,”
because while he always chose to wear a regulation
army-uniform, he was not permitted to wear
the army-button, for the reason that it bore either
the initials or the insignia of the country he had
disowned.</p>

<p>I remember, soon after I joined the navy, I was
on shore with some of the older officers from our
ship and from the <i>Brandywine</i>, which we had met
at Alexandria. We had leave to make a party and
go up to Cairo and the Pyramids. As we jogged
along (you went on donkeys then), some of the
gentlemen (we boys called them “Dons,” but the
phrase was long since changed) fell to talking about
Nolan, and some one told the system which was
adopted from the first about his books and other
reading. As he was almost never permitted to go
on shore, even though the vessel lay in port for
months, his time at the best hung heavy; and everybody
was permitted to lend him books, if they were
not published in America and made no allusion to
it. These were common enough in the old days,
when people in the other hemisphere talked of the
United States as little as we do of Paraguay. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
had almost all the foreign papers that came into the
ship, sooner or later; only somebody must go over
them first, and cut out any advertisement or stray
paragraph that alluded to America. This was a
little cruel sometimes, when the back of what was
cut out might be as innocent as Hesiod. Right in
the midst of one of Napoleon’s battles, or one of
Canning’s speeches, poor Nolan would find a great
hole, because on the back of the page of that paper
there had been an advertisement of a packet for
New York, or a scrap from the President’s message.
I say this was the first time I ever heard of this plan,
which afterwards I had enough and more than
enough to do with. I remember it, because poor
Phillips, who was of the party, as soon as the allusion
to reading was made, told a story of something
which happened at the Cape of Good Hope on
Nolan’s first voyage; and it is the only thing I ever
knew of that voyage. They had touched at the
Cape, and had done the civil thing with the English
Admiral and the fleet, and then, leaving for a long
cruise up the Indian Ocean, Phillips had borrowed
a lot of English books from an officer, which, in
those days, as indeed in these, was quite a windfall.
Among them, as the Devil would order, was the
“Lay of the Last Minstrel,” which they had all of
them heard of, but which most of them had never
seen. I think it could not have been published long.
Well, nobody thought there could be any risk of
anything national in that, though Phillips swore old
Shaw had cut out the “Tempest” from Shakespeare
before he let Nolan have it, because he said “the
Bermudas ought to be ours, and, by Jove, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be one day.” So Nolan was permitted to join the
circle one afternoon when a lot of them sat on deck
smoking and reading aloud. People do not do such
things so often now; but when I was young we got
rid of a great deal of time so. Well, so it happened
that in his turn Nolan took the book and read to
the others; and he read very well, as I know. Nobody
in the circle knew a line of the poem, only it
was all magic and Border chivalry, and was ten
thousand years ago. Poor Nolan read steadily
through the fifth canto, stopped a minute and drank
something, and then began, without a thought of
what was coming,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Who never to himself hath said,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It seems impossible to us that anybody ever heard
this for the first time; but all these fellows did then,
and poor Nolan himself went on, still unconsciously
or mechanically,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is my own, my native land!”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they all saw something was to pay; but he
expected to get through, I suppose, turned a little
pale, but plunged on,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whose heart hath ne’er within him burned,</div>
<div class="verse">As home his footsteps he hath turned</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From wandering on a foreign strand?—</div>
<div class="verse">If such there breathe, go, mark him well,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By this time the men were all beside themselves,
wishing there was any way to make him turn over
two pages; but he had not quite presence of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for that; he gagged a little, colored crimson, and
staggered on,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For him no minstrel raptures swell;</div>
<div class="verse">High though his titles, proud his name,</div>
<div class="verse">Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,</div>
<div class="verse">Despite these titles, power, and pelf,</div>
<div class="verse">The wretch, concentred all in self,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and here the poor fellow choked, could not go on,
but started up, swung the book into the sea, vanished
into his state-room, “And by Jove,” said
Phillips, “we did not see him for two months again.
And I had to make up some beggarly story to that
English surgeon why I did not return his Walter
Scott to him.”</p>

<p>That story shows about the time when Nolan’s
braggadocio must have broken down. At first, they
said he took a very high tone, considered his imprisonment
a mere farce, affected to enjoy the voyage,
and all that; but Phillips said that after he
came out of his state-room he never was the same
man again. He never read aloud again, unless it
was the Bible or Shakespeare or something else he
was sure of. But it was not that merely. He never
entered in with the other young men exactly as a
companion again. He was always shy afterwards,
when I knew him—very seldom spoke, unless he
was spoken to, except to a very few friends. He
lighted up occasionally—I remember late in his life
hearing him fairly eloquent on something which had
been suggested to him by one of Fléchier’s sermons—but
generally he had the nervous, tired look of
a heart-wounded man.</p>

<p>When Captain Shaw was coming home—if as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
say, it was Shaw—rather to the surprise of everybody,
they made one of the Windward Islands, and
lay off and on for nearly a week. The boys said
the officers were sick of salt-junk, and meant to
have turtle-soup before they came home. But after
several days the <i>Warren</i> came to the same rendezvous;
they exchanged signals; she sent to Phillips
and these homeward bound men, letters and papers
and told them she was outward-bound, perhaps to
the Mediterranean, and took poor Nolan and his
traps on the boat back to try his second cruise. He
looked very blank when he was told to get ready to
join her. He had known enough of the signs of the
sky to know that till that moment he was going
“home.” But this was a distinct evidence of something
he had not thought of, perhaps—that there
was no going home for him, even to a prison. And
this was the first of some twenty such transfers,
which brought him sooner or later into half our best
vessels, but which kept him all his life at least some
hundred miles from the country he had hoped he
might never hear of again.</p>

<p>It may have been on that second cruise—it was
once when he was up the Mediterranean—that
Mrs. Graff, the celebrated Southern beauty of those
days, danced with him. They had been lying a long
time in the Bay of Naples, and the officers were very
intimate in the English fleet, and there had been
great festivities, and our men thought they must
give a great ball on board the ship. How they ever
did it on board the <i>Warren</i> I am sure I do not
know. Perhaps it was not the <i>Warren</i>, or perhaps
ladies did not take up so much room as they do now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
They wanted to use Nolan’s state-room for something,
and they hated to do it without asking him
to the ball; so the captain said they might ask him,
if they would be responsible that he did not talk
with the wrong people, “who would give him intelligence.”
So the dance went on, the finest party
that had ever been known, I dare say; for I never
heard of a man-of-war ball that was not. For ladies
they had the family of the American consul, one or
two travellers, who had adventured so far, and a
nice bevy of English girls and matrons, perhaps
Lady Hamilton herself.</p>

<p>Well, different officers relieved each other in
standing and talking with Nolan in a friendly way,
so as to be sure that nobody else spoke to him. The
dancing went on with spirit, and after a while even
the fellows who took this honorary guard of Nolan
ceased to fear any <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>. Only when some
English lady—Lady Hamilton, as I said, perhaps—called
for a set of “American dances,” an odd
thing happened. Everybody then danced contra-dances.
The black band, nothing loath, conferred
as to what “American dances” were, and started off
with “Virginia Reel,” which they followed with
“Money Musk,” which, in its turn in those days,
should have been followed by “The Old Thirteen.”
But just as Dick, the leader, tapped for his fiddles
to begin, and bent forward, about to say, in true
negro state, “‘The Old Thirteen,’ gentlemen and
ladies!” as he had said “‘Virginny Reel,’ if you
please!” and “‘Money-Musk,’ if you please!” the
captain’s boy tapped him on the shoulder, whispered
to him, and he did not announce the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
dance; he merely bowed, began on the air, and they
all fell to—the officers teaching the English girls
the figure, but not telling them why it had no name.</p>

<p>But that is not the story I started to tell. As
the dancing went on, Nolan and our fellows all got
at ease, as I said—so much so, that it seemed quite
natural for him to bow to that splendid Mrs. Graff,
and say—</p>

<p>“I hope you have not forgotten me, Miss Rutledge.
Shall I have the honor of dancing?”</p>

<p>He did it so quickly, that Fellows, who was by
him, could not hinder him. She laughed and said—</p>

<p>“I am not Miss Rutledge any longer, Mr. Nolan;
but I will dance all the same,” just nodded to Fellows,
as if to say he must leave Mr. Nolan to her,
and led him off to the place where the dance was
forming.</p>

<p>Nolan thought he had got his chance. He had
known her at Philadelphia, and at other places had
met her, and this was a Godsend. You could not
talk in contra-dances as you do in cotillions, or even
in the pauses of waltzing; but there were chances
for tongues and sounds, as well as for eyes and
blushes. He began with her travels, and Europe,
and Vesuvius, and the French; and then, when
they had worked down, and had that long talking-time
at the bottom of the set, he said, boldly—a
little pale, she said, as she told me the story, years
after—</p>

<p>“And what do you hear from home, Mrs. Graff?”</p>

<p>And that splendid creature looked through him.
Jove! how she must have looked through him!</p>

<p>“Home!! Mr. Nolan!!! I thought you were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
man who never wanted to hear of home again!”—and
she walked directly up the deck to her husband,
and left poor Nolan alone, as he always was. He
did not dance again.</p>

<p>I cannot give any history of him in order; nobody
can now; and, indeed, I am not trying to.
These are the traditions, which I sort out, as I believe
them, from the myths which have been told
about this man for forty years. The lies that have
been told about him are legion. The fellows used
to say he was the “Iron Mask”; and poor George
Pons went to his grave in the belief that this was
the author of “Junius,” who was being punished for
his celebrated libel on Thomas Jefferson. Pons
was not very strong in the historical line. A happier
story than either of these I have told is of the
war. That came along soon after. I have heard
this affair told in three or four ways—and, indeed,
it may have happened more than once. But which
ship it was on I cannot tell. However, in one, at
least, of the great frigate-duels with the English,
in which the navy was really baptized, it happened
that a round-shot from the enemy entered one of
our ports square, and took right down the officer
of the gun himself, and almost every man of the
gun’s crew. Now you may say what you choose
about courage, but that is not a nice thing to see.
But, as the men who were not killed picked themselves
up, and as they and the surgeon’s people were
carrying off the bodies, there appeared Nolan, in
his shirt sleeves, with the rammer in his hand, and,
just as if he had been an officer, told them off with
authority—who should go to the cock-pit with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
wounded men, who should stay with him—perfectly
cheery, and with that way which makes men
feel sure all is right and is going to be right. And
he finished loading his gun with his own hands,
aimed it, and bade the men fire. And there he
stayed, captain of that gun, keeping those fellows
in spirits, till the enemy struck—sitting on the carriage
while the gun was cooling, though he was
exposed all the time—showing them easier ways
to handle heavy shot—making the raw hands laugh
at their own blunders—and when the gun cooled
again, getting it loaded and fired twice as often as
any other gun on the ship. The captain walked forward
by way of encouraging the men, and Nolan
touched his hat, and said—</p>

<p>“I am showing them how we do this in the artillery,
sir.”</p>

<p>And this is the part of the story where all the
legends agree; and the commodore said—</p>

<p>“I see you do, and I thank you, sir; and I shall
never forget this day, sir; and you never shall, sir.”</p>

<p>And after the whole thing was over, and he had
the Englishman’s sword, in the midst of the state
and ceremony of the quarter-deck, he said—</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Nolan? Ask Mr. Nolan to come
here.”</p>

<p>And when Nolan came, the captain said—</p>

<p>“Mr. Nolan, we are all very grateful to you to-day;
you are one of us to-day; you will be named in
the despatches.”</p>

<p>And then the old man took off his own sword of
ceremony, and gave it to Nolan, and made him
put it on. The man told me this who saw it. Nolan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
cried like a baby, and well he might. He had not
worn a sword since that infernal day at Fort
Adams. But always afterwards, on occasions of
ceremony, he wore that quaint old French sword of
the commodore’s.</p>

<p>The captain did mention him in the despatches.
It was always said he asked that he might be pardoned.
He wrote a special letter to the Secretary
of War. But nothing ever came of it. As I said,
that was about the time when they began to ignore
the whole transaction at Washington, and when
Nolan’s imprisonment began to carry itself on because
there was nobody to stop it without any new
orders from home.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that he was with Porter when
he took possession of the Nukahiwa Islands. Not
this Porter, you know, but old Porter, his father,
Essex Porter—that is, the old Essex Porter, not
this Essex. As an artillery officer, who had seen
service in the west, Nolan knew more about fortifications,
embrasures, ravelins, stockades, and all
that, than any of them did; and he worked with a
right good-will in fixing that battery all right. I
have always thought it was a pity Porter did not
leave him in command there with Gamble. That
would have settled all the question about his punishment.
We should have kept the islands, and at
this moment we should have one station in the
Pacific Ocean. Our French friends, too, when they
wanted this little watering-place, would have found
it was preoccupied. But Madison and the Virginians,
of course flung all that away.</p>

<p>All that was near fifty years go. If Nolan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
thirty then, he must have been near eighty when he
died. He looked sixty when he was forty. But he
never seemed to me to change a hair afterwards.
As I imagine his life, from what I have seen and
heard of it, he must have been in every sea, and yet
almost never on land. He must have known, in a
formal way, more officers in our service than any
man living knows. He told me once, with a grave
smile, that no man in the world lived so methodical
a life as he. “You know the boys say I am the Iron
Mask, and you know how busy he was.” He said
it did not do for any one to try to read all the time,
more than to do anything else all the time; but that
he read just five hours a day. “Then,” he said, “I
keep up my note-books, writing in them at such
and such hours from what I have been reading; and
I include in these my scrap-books.” These were
very curious indeed. He had six or eight, of different
subjects. There was one of History, one
of Natural Science, one which he called “Odds and
Ends.” But they were not merely books of extracts
from newspapers. They had bits of plants
and ribbons, shells tied on, and carved scraps of
bone and wood which he had taught the men to cut
for him, and they were beautifully illustrated. He
drew admirably. He had some of the funniest
drawings there, and some of the most pathetic, that
I have ever seen in my life. I wonder who will have
Nolan’s scrap-books.</p>

<p>Well, he said his reading and his notes were his
profession, and that they took five hours and two
hours respectively of each day. “Then,” said he,
“every man should have a diversion as well as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
profession. My Natural History is my diversion.”
That took two hours a day more. The men used to
bring him birds and fish, but on a long cruise he had
to satisfy himself with centipedes and cockroaches
and such small game. He was the only naturalist
I ever met who knew anything about the habits of
the house-fly and the mosquito. All those people
can tell you whether they are <i>Lepidoptera</i> or <i>Steptopotera</i>;
but as for telling how you can get rid of
them, or how they get away from you when you
strike them—why Linnæus knew as little of that as
John Fox the idiot did. These nine hours made
Nolan’s regular daily “occupation.” The rest of
the time he talked or walked. Till he grew very
old, he went aloft a great deal. He always kept up
his exercise; and I never heard that he was ill. If
any other man was ill, he was the kindest nurse in
the world; and he knew more than half the surgeons
do. Then if anybody was sick or died, or if the captain
wanted him to, on any other occasion, he was
always ready to read prayers. I have said that he
read beautifully.</p>

<p>My own acquaintance with Philip Nolan began
six or eight years after the war, on my first voyage
after I was appointed a midshipman. It was in the
first days after our Slave Trade treaty, while the
Reigning House, which was still the House of Virginia,
had still a sort of sentimentalism about the
suppression of the horrors of the Middle Passage,
and something was sometimes done that way. We
were in the South Atlantic on that business. From
the time I joined, I believe I thought Nolan was a
sort of lay chaplain—a chaplain with a blue coat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
I never asked about him. Everything in the ship
was strange to me. I knew it was green to ask
questions, and I suppose I thought there was a
“Plain-Buttons” on every ship. We had him to
dine in our mess once a week, and the caution was
given that on that day nothing was to be said about
home. But if they had told us not to say anything
about the planet Mars or the Book of Deuteronomy,
I should not have asked why; there were a
great many things which seemed to me to have as
little reason. I first came to understand anything
about “the man without a country” one day when
we overhauled a dirty little schooner which had
slaves on board. An officer was sent to take charge
of her, and, after a few minutes, he sent back his
boat to ask that some one might be sent him who
could speak Portuguese. We were all looking over
the rail when the message came, and we all wished
we could interpret, when the captain asked who
spoke Portuguese. But none of the officers did;
and just as the captain was sending forward to ask
if any of the people could, Nolan stepped out and
said he should be glad to interpret, if the captain
wished, as he understood the language. The captain
thanked him, fitted out another boat with him,
and in this boat it was my luck to go.</p>

<p>When we got there, it was such a scene as you
seldom see, and never want to. Nastiness beyond
account, and chaos run loose in the midst of the
nastiness. There were not a great many of the
negroes; but by way of making what there were understand
that they were free, Vaughan had had
their hand-cuffs and ankle-cuffs knocked off, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
for convenience sake, was putting them upon the
rascals of the schooner’s crew. The negroes were,
most of them, out of the hold, and swarming all
round the dirty deck, with a central throng surrounding
Vaughan and addressing him in every
dialect, and <i lang="fr">patois</i> of a dialect, from the Zulu click
up to the Parisian of Beledeljereed.</p>

<p>As we came on deck, Vaughan looked down from
a hogshead, on which he had mounted in desperation,
and said:</p>

<p>“For God’s love, is there anybody who can make
these wretches understand something? The men
gave them rum, and that did not quiet them. I
knocked that big fellow down twice, and that did
not soothe him. And then I talked Choctaw to all
of them together; and I’ll be hanged if they understand
that as well as they understand the English.”</p>

<p>Nolan said he could speak Portuguese, and one
or two fine-looking Kroomen were dragged out,
who, as it had been found already, had worked for
the Portuguese on the coast at Fernando Po.</p>

<p>“Tell them they are free,” said Vaughan; “and
tell them that these rascals are to be hanged as soon
as we can get rope enough.”</p>

<p>Nolan “put them into Spanish”—that is, he explained
it in such Portuguese as the Kroomen could
understand, and they in turn to such of the negroes
as could understand them. Then there was such a
yell of delight, clinching of fists, leaping and dancing,
kissing of Nolan’s feet, and a general rush
made to the hogshead by way of spontaneous
worship of Vaughan, as the <i lang="la">deus ex machina</i> of the
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell them,” said Vaughan, well pleased, “that
I will take them all to Cape Palmas.”</p>

<p>This did not answer so well. Cape Palmas was
practically as far from the homes of most of them
as New Orleans or Rio Janeiro was; that is, they
would be eternally separated from home there. And
their interpreters, as we could understand, instantly
said: “<i lang="es">Ah, non Palmas</i>,” and began to propose infinite
other expedients in most voluble language.
Vaughan was rather disappointed at this result of
his liberality, and asked Nolan eagerly what they
said. The drops stood on poor Nolan’s white forehead,
as he hushed the men down, and said:</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Not Palmas.’ He says, ‘Take us
home, take us to our own country, take us to our
own house, take us to our own pickaninnies and
our own women.’ He says he has an old father
and mother who will die if they do not see him.
And this one says he left his people all sick, and
paddled down to Fernando to beg the white doctor
to come and help them, and that these devils caught
him in the bay just in sight of home, and that he
had never seen anybody from home since then. And
this one says,” choked out Nolan, “that he has not
heard a word from his home in six months, while he
has been locked up in an infernal barracoon.”</p>

<p>Vaughan always said he grew gray himself while
Nolan struggled through this interpretation. I,
who did not understand anything of the passion involved
in it, saw that the very elements were melting
with fervent heat, and that something was
to pay somewhere. Even the negroes themselves
stopped howling, as they saw Nolan’s agony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Vaughan’s almost equal agony of sympathy. As
quick as he could get words, he said:</p>

<p>“Tell them yes, yes, yes; tell them they shall go
to the Mountains of the Moon if they will. If I
sail the schooner through the Great White Desert
they shall go home!”</p>

<p>And after some fashion Nolan said so. And
then they all fell to kissing him again, and wanted
to rub his nose with theirs.</p>

<p>But he could not stand it long; and getting
Vaughan to say he might go back, he beckoned me
down into our boat. As we lay back in the stern-sheets
and the men gave way, he said to me:
“Youngster, let that show you what it is to be without
a family, without a home, and without a country.
And if you are ever tempted to say a word
or to do a thing that shall put a bar between you
and your family, your home, and your country,
pray God in His mercy to take you that instant
home to His own heaven. Stick by your family,
boy; forget you have a self, while you do everything
for them. Think of your home, boy; write
and send, and talk about it. Let it be nearer and
nearer to your thought, the farther you have to
travel from it; and rush back to it, when you are
free, as that poor black slave is doing now. And
for your country, boy,” and the words rattled in his
throat, “and for that flag,” and he pointed to the
ship, “never dream a dream but of serving her as
she bids you, though the service carry you through
a thousand hells. No matter what happens to you,
no matter who flatters you or who abuses you,
never look at another flag, never let a night pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
but you pray God to bless that flag. Remember,
boy, that behind all these men you have to do with,
behind officers, and government, and people even,
there is the Country Herself, your Country, and
that you belong to Her as you belong to your own
mother. Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand
by your mother, if those devils there had got hold
of her to-day!”</p>

<p>I was frightened to death by his calm, hard passion;
but I blundered out, that I would, by all that
was holy, and that I had never thought of doing
anything else. He hardly seemed to hear me; but
he did, almost in a whisper, say: “O, if anybody
had said so to me when I was of your age!”</p>

<p>I think it was this half-confidence of his, which I
never abused, for I never told this story till now,
which afterward made us great friends. He was
very kind to me. Often he sat up, or even got up,
at night, to walk the deck with me, when it was
my watch. He explained to me a great deal of my
mathematics, and I owe to him my taste for mathematics.
He lent me books, and helped me about
my reading. He never alluded so directly to his
story again; but from one and another officer I
have learned, in thirty years, what I am telling.
When we parted from him in St. Thomas harbor,
at the end of our cruise, I was more sorry than I
can tell. I was very glad to meet him again in
1830; and later in life, when I thought I had some
influence in Washington, I moved heaven and
earth to have him discharged. But it was like getting
a ghost out of prison. They pretended there
was no such man, and never was such a man. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
will say so at the Department now! Perhaps they
do not know. It will not be the first thing in the
service of which the Department appears to know
nothing!</p>

<p>There is a story that Nolan met Burr once on one
of our vessels, when a party of Americans came on
board in the Mediterranean. But this I believe to
be a lie; or, rather it is a myth, <i lang="it">ben trovato</i>, involving
a tremendous blowing-up with which he sunk
Burr—asking him how he liked to be “without a
country.” But it is clear from Burr’s life that
nothing of the sort could have happened; and I
mention this only as an illustration of the stories
which get a-going where there is the least mystery
at the bottom.</p>

<p>So poor Philip Nolan had his wish fulfilled. I
know but one fate more dreadful; it is the fate
reserved for those men who shall have one day to
exile themselves from their country because they
have attempted her ruin, and shall have at the same
time to see the prosperity and honor to which she
rises when she has rid herself of them and their
iniquities. The wish of poor Nolan, as we all
learned to call him, not because his punishment
was too great, but because his repentance was so
clear, was precisely the wish of every Bragg and
Beauregard who broke a soldier’s oath two years
ago, and of every Maury and Barron who broke a
sailor’s. I do not know how often they have repented.
I do know that they have done all that in
them lay that they might have no country—that
all the honors, associations, memories, and hopes
which belong to “country” might be broken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
into little shreds and distributed to the winds. I
know, too, that their punishment, as they vegetate
through what is left of life to them in wretched
Boulognes and Leicester Squares, where they are
destined to upbraid each other till they die, will
have all the agony of Nolan’s, with the added pang
that every one who sees them will see them to
despise and to execrate them. They will have their
wish, like him.</p>

<p>For him, poor fellow, he repented of his folly,
and then, like a man, submitted to the fate he had
asked for. He never intentionally added to the
difficulty or delicacy of the charge of those who had
him in hold. Accidents would happen; but they
never happened from his fault. Lieutenant Truxton
told me, that, when Texas was annexed, there
was a careful discussion among the officers, whether
they should get hold of Nolan’s handsome set of
maps, and cut Texas out of it—from the map of
the world and the map of Mexico. The United
States had been cut out when the atlas was bought
for him. But it was voted, rightly enough, that to
do this would be virtually to reveal to him what had
happened, or, as Harry Cole said, to make him
think Old Burr had succeeded. So it was from no
fault of Nolan’s that a great botch happened at
my own table, when, for a short time, I was in
command of the <i>George Washington</i> corvette, on
the South American station. We were lying in
the La Plata, and some of the officers, who had
been on shore, and had just joined again, were entertaining
us with accounts of their misadventures
in riding the half-wild horses of Buenos Ayres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Nolan was at table, and was in an unusually bright
and talkative mood. Some story of a tumble reminded
him of an adventure of his own, when he
was catching wild horses in Texas with his adventurous
cousin at a time when he must have been
quite a boy. He told the story with a good deal of
spirit—so much so, that the silence which often follows
a good story hung over the table for an instant,
to be broken by Nolan himself. For he asked perfectly
unconsciously:</p>

<p>“Pray, what has become of Texas? After the
Mexicans got their independence, I thought that
province of Texas would come forward very fast.
It is really one of the finest regions on earth; it is
the Italy of this continent. But I have not seen or
heard a word of Texas for near twenty years.”</p>

<p>There were two Texan officers at the table. The
reason he had never heard of Texas was that Texas
and her affairs had been painfully cut out of his
newspapers since Austin began his settlements; so
that, while he read of Honduras and Tamaulipas,
and, till quite lately, of California—this virgin
province, in which his brother had travelled so far,
and, I believe, had died, had ceased to be to him.
Waters and Williams, the two Texas men, looked
grimly at each other, and tried not to laugh. Edward
Morris had his attention attracted by the
third link in the chain of the chaplain’s chandelier.
Waters was seized with a convulsion of sneezing.
Nolan himself saw that something was to pay, he
did not know what. And I, as master of the feast,
had to say—</p>

<p>“Texas is out of the map, Mr. Nolan. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
seen Captain Back’s curious account of Sir Thomas
Roe’s Welcome?”</p>

<p>After that cruise I never saw Nolan again. I
wrote to him at least twice a year, for in that voyage
we became even confidentially intimate; but he
never wrote to me. The other men tell me that in
those fifteen years he <em>aged</em> very fast, as well he
might indeed, but that he was still the same gentle,
uncomplaining, silent sufferer that he ever was,
bearing as best he could his self-appointed punishment—rather
less social, perhaps, with new men
whom he did not know, but more anxious, apparently,
than ever to serve and befriend and teach the
boys, some of whom fairly seemed to worship him.
And now it seems the dear old fellow is dead. He
has found a home at last, and a country.</p>

<p class="tb">Since writing this, and while considering whether
or no I would print it, as a warning to the young
Nolans and Vallandighams and Tatnalls of to-day
of what it is to throw away a country, I have received
from Danforth, who is on board the <i>Levant</i>,
a letter which gives an account of Nolan’s last
hours. It removes all my doubts about telling this
story.</p>

<p>To understand the first words of the letter, the
non-professional reader should remember that after
1817, the position of every officer who had Nolan in
charge was one of the greatest delicacy. The government
had failed to renew the order of 1807 regarding
him. What was a man to do? Should he
let him go? What, then, if he were called to account
by the Department for violating the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
1807? Should he keep him? What, then, if Nolan
should be liberated some day, and should bring
an action for false imprisonment or kidnapping
against every man who had had him in charge? I
urged and pressed this upon Southward, and I have
reason to think that other officers did the same
thing. But the Secretary always said, as they so
often do at Washington, that there were no special
orders to give, and that we must act on our own
judgment. That means, “If you succeed, you will
be sustained; if you fail, you will be disavowed.”
Well, as Danforth says, all that is over now, though
I do not know but I expose myself to a criminal
prosecution on the evidence of the very revelation
I am making.</p>

<p>Here is the letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>Levant</i>, 2° 2´ S. at 131° W.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Fred</span>:—I try to find heart and life to tell
you that it is all over with dear old Nolan. I have
been with him on this voyage more than I ever was,
and I can understand wholly now the way in which
you used to speak of the dear old fellow. I could
see that he was not strong, but I had no idea the
end was so near. The doctor has been watching
him very carefully, and yesterday morning came to
me and told me that Nolan was not so well, and had
not left his state-room—a thing I never remember
before. He had let the doctor come and see him
as he lay there—the first time the doctor had been
in the state-room—and he said he should like to see
me. O dear! do you remember the mysteries we
boys used to invent about his room, in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
<i>Intrepid</i> days? Well, I went in, and there, to be
sure, the poor fellow lay in his berth, smiling pleasantly
as he gave me his hand, but looking very frail.
I could not help a glance round, which showed me
what a little shrine he had made of the box he was
lying in. The stars and stripes were triced up
above and around a picture of Washington, and he
had painted a majestic eagle, with lightnings blazing
from his beak and his foot just clasping the
whole globe, which his wings overshadowed. The
dear old boy saw my glance, and said, with a sad
smile, ‘Here, you see, I have a country!’ And
then he pointed to the foot of his bed, where I had
not seen before a great map of the United States,
as he had drawn it from memory, and which he had
there to look upon as he lay. Quaint, queer old
names were on it, in large letters: ‘Indiana Territory,’
‘Mississippi Territory,’ and ‘Louisiana Territory,’
as I suppose our fathers learned such things;
but the old fellow had patched in Texas, too; he
had carried his western boundary all the way to the
Pacific, but on that shore he had defined nothing.</p>

<p>“‘O Danforth,’ he said, ‘I know I am dying. I
cannot get home. Surely you will tell me something
now?—Stop! stop! Do not speak till I say
what I am sure you know, that there is not in this
ship, that there is not in America—God bless her!—A
more loyal man than I. There cannot be a
man who loves the old flag as I do, or prays for it as
I do, or hopes for it as I do. There are thirty-four
stars in it now, Danforth. I thank God for that,
though I do not know what their names are. There
has never been one taken away: I thank God for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that. I know by that that there has never been
any successful Burr. O Danforth, Danforth,’ he
sighed out, ‘how like a wretched night’s dream a
boy’s idea of personal fame or of separate sovereignty
seems, when one looks back on it after
such a life as mine! But tell me—tell me something—tell
me everything, Danforth, before I
die!’</p>

<p>“Ingham, I swear to you that I felt like a monster
that I had not told him everything before.
Danger or no danger, delicacy or no delicacy, who
was I, that I should have been acting the tyrant all
this time over this dear, sainted old man, who had
years ago expiated, in his whole manhood’s life, the
madness of a boy’s treason? ‘Mr. Nolan,’ said I,
‘I will tell you everything you ask about. Only,
where shall I begin?’</p>

<p>“O the blessed smile that crept over his white
face! and he pressed my hand and said, ‘God bless
you!’ ‘Tell me their names,’ he said, and he pointed
to the stars on the flag. The last I know is Ohio.
My father lived in Kentucky. But I have guessed
Michigan and Indiana and Mississippi—that was
where Fort Adams is—they make twenty. But
where are your other fourteen? You have not cut
up any of the old ones, I hope?’</p>

<p>“Well, that was not a bad text, and I told him
the names in as good order as I could, and he bade
me take down his beautiful map and draw them in
as best I could with my pencil. He was wild with
delight about Texas, told me how his cousin died
there; he had marked a gold cross near where he
supposed his grave was; and he had guessed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Texas. Then he was delighted as he saw California
and Oregon;—that, he said, he had suspected partly,
because he had never been permitted to land on
that shore, though the ships were there so much.
‘And the men,’ said he, laughing, ‘brought off a
good deal besides furs.’ Then he went back—heavens,
how far!—to ask about the <i>Chesapeake</i>,
and what was done to Barron for surrendering her
to the <i>Leopard</i>, and whether Burr ever tried again—and
he ground his teeth with the only passion he
showed. But in a moment that was over, and he
said, ‘God forgive me, for I am sure I forgive him.’
Then he asked about the old war—told me the true
story of his serving the gun the day we took the
<i>Java</i>—asked about dear old David Porter, as he
called him. Then he settled down more quietly,
and very happily, to hear me tell in an hour the history
of fifty years.</p>

<p>“How I wished it had been somebody who knew
something! But I did as well as I could. I told
him of the English war. I told him about Fulton
and the steamboat beginning. I told him about old
Scott, and Jackson; told him all I could think of
about the Mississippi, and New Orleans, and Texas,
and his own old Kentucky. And do you think, he
asked who was in command of the ‘Legion of the
West.’ I told him it was a very gallant officer
named Grant, and that, by our last news, he was
about to establish his headquarters at Vicksburg.
Then, ‘Where is Vicksburg?’ I worked that out
on the map; it was about a hundred miles, more or
less, above his old Fort Adams; and I thought Fort
Adams must be a ruin now. ‘It must be at old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Vick’s plantation, at Walnut Hills,’ said he: ‘well,
that is a change!’</p>

<p>“I tell you, Ingham, it was a hard thing to condense
the history of half a century into that talk
with a sick man. And I do not now know what I
told him—of emigration, and the means of it—of
steamboats, and railroads, and telegraphs—of inventions,
and books, and literature—of the colleges,
and West Point, and the Naval School—but with
the queerest interruptions that ever you heard.
You see it was Robinson Crusoe asking all the accumulated
questions of fifty-six years!</p>

<p>“I remember he asked, all of a sudden, who was
President now; and when I told him, he asked if
Old Abe was General Benjamin Lincoln’s son.
He said he met old General Lincoln, when he was
quite a boy himself, at some Indian treaty. I said
no, that Old Abe was a Kentuckian like himself,
but I could not tell him of what family; he had
worked up from the ranks. ‘Good for him!’ cried
Nolan; ‘I’m glad of that. As I have brooded and
wondered, I have thought our danger was in keeping
up those regular successions in the first families.’</p>

<p>“Then I got talking about my visit to Washington.
I told him of meeting the Oregon congressman,
Harding; I told him about the Smithsonian,
and the Exploring Expedition; I told him
about the Capitol, and the statues for the pediment,
and Crawford’s Liberty, and Greenough’s
Washington: Ingham, I told him everything I
could think of that would show the grandeur of his
country and its prosperity; but I could not make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
up my mouth to tell him a word about this infernal
Rebellion!</p>

<p>“And he drank it in, and enjoyed it as I cannot
tell you. He grew more and more silent, yet I
never thought he was tired or faint. I gave him a
glass of water, but he just wet his lips, and told me
not to go away. Then he asked me to bring the
Presbyterian ‘Book of Public Prayer,’ which lay
there, and said, with a smile that it would open at
the right place—and so it did.</p>

<p>“There was his double red mark down the page;
and I knelt down and read, and he repeated with
me, ‘For ourselves and our country, O gracious
God, we thank Thee, that, notwithstanding our
manifold transgressions for Thy holy laws, Thou
hast continued to us Thy marvellous kindness,’—and
so to the end of that thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Then he turned to the end of the same book, and
I read the words more familiar to me: ‘Most heartily
we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and
bless Thy servant, the President of the United
States, and all others in authority,’—and the rest
of the Episcopal collect. ‘Danforth,’ said he, ‘I
have repeated those prayers night and morning, it
is now fifty-five years.’ And then he said he would
go to sleep.</p>

<p>“He bent me down over him and kissed me; and
he said, ‘Look in my Bible, Danforth, when I am
gone.’ And I went away.</p>

<p>“But I had no thought it was the end. I thought
he was tired and would sleep. I knew he was happy
and I wanted him to be alone.</p>

<p>“But in an hour, when the doctor went in gently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
he found Nolan had breathed his life away with a
smile. He had something pressed close to his lips.
It was his father’s badge of the Order of the Cincinnati.</p>

<p>“We looked in his Bible, and there was a slip of
paper at the place where he had marked the
text:—</p>

<p>“‘They desire a country, even a heavenly: wherefore
God is not ashamed to be called their God: for
he hath prepared for them a city.’</p>

<p>“On this slip of paper he had written:—</p>

<p>“‘Bury me in the sea; it has been my home, and
I love it. But will not some one set up a stone for
my memory at Fort Adams or at Orleans, that my
disgrace may not be more than I ought to bear?
Say on it:—</p>

<p class="center">“‘<i>In Memory of</i></p>

<h2 id="THE_FOREMAN">THE FOREMAN</h2>

<p class="author">By Stewart Edward White</p>

<p class="dropcap">A man is one thing; a man <em>plus</em> his work is
another, entirely different. You can learn
this anywhere, but in the lumber woods best of all.</p>

<p>Especially is it true of the camp boss, the foreman.
A firm that knows its business knows this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and so never considers merely what sort of a character
a candidate may bear in town. He may drink
or abstain, may exhibit bravery or cowardice,
strength or weakness—it is all one to the lumbermen
who employ him. In the woods his quality
must appear. So often the man most efficient and
trusted in the especial environment of his work is
the most disreputable outside it. The mere dignifying
quality of labor raises his value to the <em>n</em>th
power. In it he discovers the self-respect which, in
one form or another, is absolutely necessary to the
man who counts. His resolution to succeed has
back of it this necessity of self-respect, and so is
invincible. A good boss gives back before nothing
which will further his job.</p>

<p>Most people in the North Country understand
this double standard; but occasionally someone,
either stupid or inexperienced or unobservant,
makes the mistake of concluding that the town-character
and the woods-character are necessarily
the same. If he acts in accordance with that erroneous
idea, he gets into trouble. Take the case of
Silver Jack and the walking boss of Morrison &amp;
Daly, for instance. Silver Jack imagined his first
encounter with Richard Darrell in Bay City indicated
the certainty of like results to his second encounter
with that individual in Camp Thirty. His
mistake was costly; but almost anybody could have
told him better. To understand the case, you must
first meet Richard Darrell.</p>

<p>The latter was a man about five feet six inches
in height, slenderly built, yet with broad, hanging
shoulders. His face was an exact triangle, beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with a mop of red-brown hair, and ending with
a pointed chin. Two level quadrilaterals served
him as eyebrows, beneath which a strong hooked
nose separated his round, brown, chipmunk’s eyes.
When he walked, he threw his heavy shoulders
slightly forward. This, in turn, projected his eager,
nervous countenance. The fact that he was accustomed
to hold his hands half open, with the palms
square to the rear, lent him a peculiarly ready and
truculent air. His name, as has been said, was
Richard Darrell; but men called him Roaring Dick.</p>

<p>For upward of fifteen years he had been woods
foreman for Morrison &amp; Daly, the great lumber
firm of the Beeson Lake district. That would make
him about thirty-eight years old. He did not look
it. His firm thought everything of him in spite of
the fact that his reputation made it exceedingly
difficult to hire men for his camps. He had the
name of a “driver.” But this little man, in some
mysterious way of his own, could get in the logs.
There was none like him. About once in three
months he would suddenly appear, worn and haggard,
at Beeson Lake, where he would drop into an
iron bed, which the Company maintained for that
especial purpose. Tim Brady, the care-taker, would
bring him food at stated intervals. After four days
of this, he would as suddenly disappear into the
forest, again charged with the vital, restless energy
which kept him on his feet fourteen hours a day
until the next break down. When he looked directly
at you, this nerve-force seemed to communicate
itself to you with the physical shock of an
impact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard Darrell usually finished banking his season’s
cut a month earlier than anybody else. Then
he drew his pay at Beeson Lake, took the train for
Bay City, and set out to have a good time. Whiskey
was its main element. On his intensely nervous
organization it acted like poison. He would do the
wildest things. After his money was all spent, he
started up river for the log-drive, hollow-eyed,
shaking. In twenty-four hours he was himself
again, dominant, truculent, fixing his brown chipmunk
eyes on the delinquents with the physical
shock of an impact, coolly balancing beneath the
imminent ruin of a jam.</p>

<p>Silver Jack, on the other hand, was not nervous
at all, but very tall and strong, with bronze-red
skin, and flaxen white hair, mustache and eyebrows.
The latter peculiarity earned him his nickname.
He was at all times absolutely fearless and self-reliant
in regard to material conditions, but singularly
unobservant and stupid when it was a question
of psychology. He had been a sawyer in his early
experience, but later became a bartender in
Muskegon.</p>

<p>He was in general a good-humored animal
enough, but fond of a swagger, given to showing
off, and exceedingly ugly when his passions were
aroused.</p>

<p>His first hard work, after arriving in Bay City,
was, of course, to visit the saloons. In one of these
he came upon Richard Darrell. The latter was
enjoying himself noisily by throwing wine-glasses
at a beer advertisement. As he always paid liberally
for the glasses, no one thought of objecting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s th’ bucko?” inquired Silver Jack of a
man near the stove.</p>

<p>“That’s Roaring Dick Darrell, walkin’ boss for
M. &amp; D.,” replied the other.</p>

<p>Silver Jack drew his flax-white eyebrows together.</p>

<p>“Roaring Dick, eh? Roaring Dick? Fine name
fer a bad man. I s’pose he thinks he’s perticular
reckless, don’t he?”</p>

<p>“I do’no. Guess he is. He’s got th’ name fer it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Silver Jack, drawing his powerful
back into a bow, “I ain’t much; but I don’t like
noise—’specially roaring.”</p>

<p>With the words he walked directly across the
saloon to the foreman.</p>

<p>“My name is Silver Jack,” said he, “I come from
Muskegon way. I don’t like noise. Quit it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>The other was astonished. Then he recovered
his swagger and went on:</p>

<p>“They tell me you’re the old he-coon of this
neck of th’ woods. P’r’aps you <em>were</em>. But I’m
here now. Ketch on? I’m th’ boss of this shebang
now.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled amiably. “All right,” he repeated.</p>

<p>This second acquiescence nonplussed the newcomer.
But he insisted on his fight.</p>

<p>“You’re a bluff,” said he, insultingly.</p>

<p>“Ah! get out!” replied Dick with disgust.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” shouted the stranger, towering
with threatening bulk over the smaller man.</p>

<p>And then to his surprise Dick Darrell began to
beg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you hit me!” he cried, “I ain’t done nothing
to you. You let me alone! Don’t you let him
touch me!” he called beseechingly to the barkeeper.
“I don’t want to get hurt. Stop it! Let me be!”</p>

<p>Silver Jack took Richard Darrell by the collar
and propelled him rapidly to the door. The foreman
hung back like a small boy in the grasp of a
schoolmaster, whining, beseeching, squirming, appealing
for help to the barkeeper and the bystanders.
When finally he was energetically kicked into
the gutter, he wept a little with nervous rage.</p>

<p>“Roaring Dick! Rats!” said Silver Jack. “Anybody
can do him proper. If that’s your ‘knocker,’
you’re a gang of high bankers.”</p>

<p>The other men merely smiled in the manner of
those who know. Incidentally Silver Jack was
desperately pounded by Big Dan, later in the evening,
on account of that “high-banker” remark.</p>

<p>Richard Darrell, soon after, went into the woods
with his crew, and began the tremendous struggle
against the wilderness. Silver Jack and Big Dan
took up the saloon business at Beeson Lake, and
set themselves to gathering a clientèle which should
do them credit.</p>

<p>The winter was a bad one for everybody. Deep
snows put the job behind; frequent storms undid the
work of an infinitely slow patience. When the logging
roads were cut through, the ground failed to
freeze because of the thick white covering that
overlaid it. Darrell in his mysterious compelling
fashion managed somehow. Everywhere his thin
eager triangle of a face with the brown chipmunk
eyes was seen, bullying the men into titanic exertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
by the mere shock of his nervous force. Over
the thin crust of ice cautious loads of a few thousand
feet were drawn to the banks of the river.
The road-bed held. Gradually it hardened and
thickened. The size of the loads increased. Finally
Billy O’Brien drew up triumphantly at the rollway.</p>

<p>“There’s a rim-racker!” he exclaimed. “Give
her all she’ll stand, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Hall, the scaler, laid his flexible rule over
the face of each log. The men gathered, interested
in this record load.</p>

<p>“Thirteen thousand two hundred and forty,” announced
the scaler at last.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” crowed Billy O’Brien, “that’ll lay
out Rollway Charley by two thousand feet!”</p>

<p>The men congratulated him on his victory over
the other teamster, Rollway Charley. Suddenly
Darrell was among them, eager, menacing, thrusting
his nervous face and heavy shoulders here and
there in the crowd, bullying them back to the work
which they were neglecting. When his back was
turned they grumbled at him savagely, threatening
to disobey, resolving to quit. Some of them did
quit: but none of them disobeyed.</p>

<p>Now the big loads were coming in regularly, and
the rollways became choked with the logs dumped
down on them from the sleighs. There were not
enough men to roll them down to the river, nor to
“deck” them there in piles. Work accumulated.
The cant-hook men became discouraged. What
was the use of trying? They might as well take it
easy. They did take it easy. As a consequence the
teamsters had often to wait two, three hours to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
unloaded. They were out until long after dark,
feeling their way homeward through hunger and
cold.</p>

<p>Dick Darrell, walking boss of all the camps, did
the best he could. He sent message after message
to Beeson Lake demanding more men. If the rollways
could be definitely cleared once, the work
would lighten all along the line. Then the men
would regain their content. More help was promised,
but it was slow in coming. The balance hung
trembling. At any moment the foreman expected
the crisis, when the men, discouraged by the accumulation
of work, would begin to “jump,” would
ask for their “time” and quit, leaving the job half
finished in the woods. This catastrophe must not
happen. Darrell himself worked like a demon until
dark, and then, ten to one, while the other men
rested, would strike feverishly across to Camp
Twenty-eight or Camp Forty, where he would consult
with Morgan or Scotty Parsons until far into
the night. His pale, triangular face showed the
white lines of exhaustion, but his chipmunk eyes
and his eager movements told of a determination
stronger than any protest of a mere nature.</p>

<p>Now fate ordained that Silver Jack for the purposes
of his enlightenment should select just this
moment to drum up trade. He was, in his way,
as anxious to induce the men to come out of the
woods as Richard Darrell was to keep them in.
Beeson Lake at this time of year was very dull.
Only a few chronic loafers, without money, ornamented
the saloon walls. On the other hand, at
the four camps of Morrison &amp; Daly were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
hundred men each with four months’ pay coming
to him. In the ordinary course of events these men
would not be out for sixty days yet, but Silver Jack
and Big Dan perfectly well knew that it only
needed the suggestion, the temptation, to arouse
the spirit of restlessness. That a taste or so of whiskey
will shiver the patience of men oppressed by
long monotony is as A B C to the North Country
saloon-keeper. Silver Jack resolved to make the
rounds of the camps sure that the investment of a
few jugs of whiskey would bring down to Beeson
Lake at least thirty or forty woods-wearied men.</p>

<p>Accordingly he donned many clothes, and drove
out into the wilderness a cutter containing three
jugs and some cigars in boxes. He anticipated
trouble. Perhaps he would even have to lurk in the
woods, awaiting his opportunity to smuggle his
liquor to the men.</p>

<p>However, luck favored him. At Camp Twenty-eight
he was able to dodge unseen into the men’s
camp. When Morgan, the camp foreman, finally
discovered his presence, the mischief had been done.
Everybody was smoking cigars, everybody was happily
conscious of a warm glow at the pit of the
stomach, everybody was firmly convinced that Silver
Jack was the best fellow on earth. Morgan
could do nothing. An attempt to eject Silver Jack,
an expostulation even, would, he knew, lose him his
entire crew. The men, their heads whirling with
the anticipated delights of a spree, would indignantly
champion their new friend. Morgan retired
grimly to the “office.” There, the next morning, he
silently made out the “time” of six men, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
decided to quit. He wondered what would become
of the rollways.</p>

<p>Silver Jack, for the sake of companionship, took
one of the “jumpers” in the cutter with him. He
was pleased over his success, and intended now to
try Camp Thirty, Darrell’s headquarters. In regard
to Morgan he had been somewhat uneasy, for
he had never encountered that individual; but Darrell
he thought he knew. The trouble at Bay City
had inspired him with a great contempt for the
walking boss. That is where his mistake came in.</p>

<p>It was very cold. The snow was up to the horses’
bellies, so Silver Jack had to drive at a plunging
walk. Occasionally one or the other of the two
stood up and thrashed his arms about. At noon
they ate sandwiches of cold fried bacon, which the
frost rendered brittle as soon as it left the warmth
of their inside pockets. Underfoot the runners of
the cutter shrieked loudly. They saw the tracks of
deer and wolves and partridge, and encountered a
few jays, chickadees, and woodpeckers. Otherwise
the forest seemed quite empty. By half-past two
they had made nine miles, and the sun, in this high
latitude, was swinging lower. Silver Jack spoke
angrily to his struggling animals. The other had
fallen into silence of numbness.</p>

<p>They did not know that across the reaches of the
forest a man was hurrying to intercept them, a man
who hastened to cope with this new complication as
readily as he would have coped with the emergency
of a lack of flour or the sickness of horses. They
drove confidently.</p>

<p>Suddenly from nowhere a figure appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
trail before them. It stood, silent and impassive,
with forward-drooping, heavy shoulders, watching
the approaching cutter through inscrutable chipmunk
eyes. When the strangers had approached
to within a few feet of this man, the horses stopped
of their own accord.</p>

<p>“Hello, Darrell,” greeted Silver Jack, tugging at
one of the stone jugs beneath the seat, “you’re just
the man I wanted to see.”</p>

<p>The figure made no reply.</p>

<p>“Have a drink,” offered the big man, finally extricating
the whiskey.</p>

<p>“You can’t take that whiskey into camp,” said
Darrell.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so,” replied Silver Jack, easily, hoping
for the peaceful solution. “There ain’t enough
to get anybody full. Have a taster, Darrell; it’s
pretty good stuff.”</p>

<p>“I mean it,” repeated Darrell. “You got to go
back.” He seized the horses’ bits and began to lead
them in the reversing circle.</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” cried Silver Jack. “You let
them horses alone! You old little runt! Let
them alone I say!” The robe was kicked aside, and
Silver Jack prepared to descend.</p>

<p>Richard Darrell twisted his feet out of his snow-shoe
straps. “You can’t take that whiskey into
camp,” he repeated simply.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Darrell,” said the other in even
tones, “don’t you make no mistake. I ain’t selling
this whiskey; I’m <em>giving</em> it away. The law can’t
touch me. You ain’t any right to say where I’ll
go, and I’m going where I please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“You got to go back with that whiskey,” replied
Darrell.</p>

<p>Silver Jack threw aside his coat, and advanced.
“You get out of my way, or I’ll kick you out, like
I done at Bay City.”</p>

<p>In an instant two blows were exchanged. The
first marked Silver Jack’s bronze-red face just to
the left of his white eyebrow. The second sent Richard
Darrell gasping and sobbing into the snow-bank
ten feet away. He arose with the blood streaming
from beneath his mustache. His eager, nervous
face was white; his chipmunk eyes narrowed; his
great hands, held palm backward, clutched spasmodically.
With the stealthy motion of a cat he
approached his antagonist, and sprang. Silver
Jack stood straight and confident, awaiting him.
Three times the aggressor was knocked entirely off
his feet. The fourth he hit against the cutter body,
and his fingers closed on the axe which all voyagers
through the forest carry as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“He’s gettin’ ugly. Come on, Hank!” cried Silver
Jack.</p>

<p>The other man, with a long score to pay the walking
boss, seized the iron starting-bar, and descended.
Out from the inscrutable white forest murder
breathed like a pestilential air. The two men talked
about it easily, confidently.</p>

<p>“You ketch him on one side, and I’ll come in on
the other,” said the man named Hank, gripping his
short, heavy bar.</p>

<p>The forest lay behind; the forest, easily penetrable
to a man in moccasins. Richard Darrell could
at any moment have fled beyond the possibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
pursuit. This had become no mere question of a
bar-room fisticuff, but of life and death. He had
begged abjectly from the pain of a cuff on the ear;
now he merely glanced over his shoulder toward
the safety that lay beyond. Then, with a cry, he
whirled the axe about his head and threw it directly
at the second of his antagonists. The flat of the
implement struck heavily, full on the man’s forehead.
He fell, stunned. Immediately the other
two precipitated themselves on the weapons. This
time Silver Jack secured the axe, while Darrell had
to content himself with the short, heavy bar. The
strange duel recommenced, while the horses, mildly
curious, gazed through the steam of their nostrils
at their warring masters.</p>

<p>Overhead the ravens of the far north idled to and
fro. When the three men lay still on the trampled
snow, they stooped, nearer and nearer. Then they
towered. One of the men had stirred.</p>

<p>Richard Darrell painfully cleared his eyes and
dragged himself to a sitting position, sweeping the
blood of his shallow wound from his forehead. He
searched out the axe. With it he first smashed in
the whiskey jugs. Then he wrecked the cutter,
chopping it savagely until it was reduced to splinters
and twisted iron. By the time this was done,
his antagonists were in the throes of returning consciousness.
He stood over them, dominant, menacing.</p>

<p>“You hit th’ back trail,” said he, “very quick!
Don’t you let me see you ’round these diggings
again.”</p>

<p>Silver Jack, bewildered, half stunned, not understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
this little cowardly man who had permitted
himself to be kicked from the saloon, rose slowly.</p>

<p>“You stand there!” commanded Darrell. He
opened a pocket-knife, and cut the harness to bits,
leaving only the necessary head-stalls intact.</p>

<p>“Now git!” said he. “Pike out!—fer Beeson
Lake. Don’t you stop at no Camp Twenty-eight!”</p>

<p>Appalled at the prospect of the long journey
through the frozen forest, Silver Jack and his companion
silently led the horses away. As they
reached the bend in the trail, they looked back. The
sun was just setting through the trees, throwing
the illusion of them gigantic across the eye. And
he stood there huge, menacing, against the light—the
dominant spirit, Roaring Dick of the woods, the
incarnation of Necessity, the Man defending his
Work, the Foreman!</p>

<h2 id="THE_GRAY_COLLIE">THE GRAY COLLIE</h2>

<p class="author">By Georgia Wood Pangborn</p>

<p class="dropcap">The steam had retired, clanking, from the radiator,
withdrawing to the cellar like the
dragging chain of Marley’s ghost. The blue flame
of a Bunsen burner was the only light and heat
left. Now and then the wind flung handfuls of
spiteful sleet at the window.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about ghosts,” said Henrietta,
plaintively. “I’m as bad in psychology as
mathematics. I might tell about the gray collie,
but he was real. Don’t let that chocolate boil over,
Isabel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>Isabel poured out three steaming cups, thick and
sweet, for in the young twenties and late teens the
appetite is still bizarre.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell it as it happened,” sighed Henrietta.
“I don’t believe I could make anything up to save
my neck.”</p>

<p>She was small and sad-eyed, with a timid manner,
and sat on a wolf-skin, leaning one elbow on
its head, which had green eyes of sinister slant,
and bristling ears.</p>

<p>“You know who Artaxerxes was?”</p>

<p>“Artaxerxes,” they recited, “was your old wolf-hound
who was really benevolent, but everybody
was afraid of him, and when he wagged his tail it
waved like a cat’s, sinuously, instead of swinging
in a clubby, careless way, as a dog’s should.”</p>

<p>“He was white with gray spots,” mused Henrietta;
“I suppose his family in Siberia looked like
that to match the snow when they went out hunting,
and he was shaggy and soft.</p>

<p>“We chained him the night the circus came to
town. He heard a lion roar as the train went by
at three o’clock, and, at first, I thought we had
another lion in the barn. Gracious! If he hadn’t
been chained he would have been over the wall and
chased that lion to the station.</p>

<p>“I went down to soothe him and see if his chain
had given in any of its links. I never saw him so
out of temper. Finally he consented to lie down,
though he grumbled about it, and the tip of his tail
kept twitching, not wagging. He hardly ever
wagged it.</p>

<p>“He worried all that day. ‘Don’t you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
there are bears and lions and tigers and wolves out
there?’ he’d say—‘Isn’t it my business to protect
you from such things? Do let me go and kill a
few. I’ll come right back!’</p>

<p>“We supposed he would stop worrying when the
circus went, but instead, he got worse. He explained
how it was his business to find out what
had become of all those animals. In the evenings,
as soon as he was unchained, he would march up
and down inside the wall, holding his nose to the
wind and every now and then making a low impatient
sound in his throat, as if he were worried
about something and making plans.</p>

<p>“One morning Farmer Grosman came to our
house, very fierce: ‘Your dog’s been killing my
sheep.’ We explained that he never got over the
six-foot wall, but nothing would do. If he hadn’t
done it, who had? If we did not shoot him, he
would, and so on.</p>

<p>“Papa was very polite. He said he regretted
that he could allow no shooting on the place except
what he did himself. ‘You are certainly entitled
to shoot any dog or dogs which you may discover
molesting your sheep, and I shall exercise the same
prerogative in protecting my dog.’</p>

<p>“He said it with that deprecating smile of his—I
believe he smiled deprecatingly when he got cut
off from his men at Antietam, and fought his way
out of a lot of rebels who tried to make him prisoner.
He hated Grosman, who was the meanest
man in town and starved his horses.</p>

<p>“The man went off growling, and said he’d see
the Mayor. We chained Artie up that night. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the morning we found his cat, dead, with a half-eaten
piece of poisoned meat beside it. Artie
thought everything of that cat. He had carried it
around in his mouth ever since it was a little kitten.
He always had to have his cat, the way a child has
to have a doll. Any other cat he’d have sighted
half a mile away and chased. But that one was his
own, and anything it did was all right. It’s all in
being acquainted. Papa sat up all the next night
with a shotgun. We heard that the people from
the French quarter of the village insisted that Artie
got over the wall at night and roamed around and
got into mischief. They said they heard him howling
up on Mount Phelim, and talked a great deal
about what they were going to do to him and us.
Those Canucks would have it that he was a man-wolf,
and could change about from one thing to
another. You can’t argue with them, when they
get a notion like that.</p>

<p>“One morning Pete Lancto, who mows the lawn,
said he had seen the devil, and that he was like a
shaggy dog.</p>

<p>“‘Probably it <em>was</em> a dog!’ I said. But he told
a lot of lies about smelling brimstone and flames
coming out of its eyes.</p>

<p>“I said: ‘I guess you were <em>tenet</em>’ (that’s their
word for ‘tight’).</p>

<p>“But he hadn’t touched a drop, and had only
been to get a new salt codfish at the store.</p>

<p>“‘Well, anyway, if it smelt of brimstone, it
wasn’t Artie.’</p>

<p>“But that idiot said: ‘The devil, he can smell
brimstone when he wants to—<i lang="fr">je pense que oui</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I let him alone. You can’t argue with a
man who hasn’t any premises to argue from.</p>

<p>“It was my work to go to the village for the
mail. I went after supper, about sunset, or a little
later.</p>

<p>“The road curves along the side of Mount Phelim,
which is not much of a mountain, but rather
too big for a hill. When you look south it is as if
the trees stood on each others’ heads, and there are
wide, open spaces, like a park, so that you can see
between the trunks, only by the road the underbrush
is thick like a hedge. But on the north side
of the road you don’t want to tumble off, for the
Powasket runs below, hidden under the tops of
trees, so that you only know it’s there from the
sound. When I was little, I used to be afraid of
that road, because a Canuck nurse-girl had scared
me with stories of bears and catamounts and
Indians.</p>

<p>“That was why papa had me go for the mail.
He never could stand cowards. At first he used
to sneak along behind me, and when I got hysterical
would saunter up as if he were just out for a
walk, and show me how pretty the sunset was over
toward Canada, or cluck for squirrels to come out
and see what we wanted, or take me up into the
woods a little to find Indian pipes like caryatides
holding up dead leaves. So it wasn’t very long
before I grew to love the walk, and the sound of the
wind in the trees, even when it was dark. I got
quite friendly with the squirrels, and used to leave
little piles of nuts as I went to the village, and
when I came back they would be all gone. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
aren’t many squirrels up there that can afford pecans
and Brazil-nuts. I suppose they wondered till
their heads ached why I left them around so carelessly.</p>

<p>“But when I grew to like it at night, papa began
to object. A good many times when I’ve been
sitting on the edge of the road swinging my feet
over the Powasket, watching the last color going
out beyond Canada, and listening to the owls and
frogs and things, he has come to meet me and
grumbled about ‘going to extremes.’ But I had
him, you see, and only laughed. Hadn’t he trained
me to do it?</p>

<p>“So about that time he got me Artaxerxes for
a chaperone, and he was a good deal of a nuisance,
for the village folk disliked him from the first.
When they whistled to their own dogs to get them
out of his way, how could he tell they weren’t calling
to him? And when he’d turn to see what they
wanted, they’d think he was coming after them and
run, which was nonsense.</p>

<p>“We were keeping Artie chained that week of
the sheep-killing fuss. How he hated it! When I
stepped upon the horse-block to mount Pixie—I
rode most of that week, and he knew I never took
him when I took Pixie, because he had a nasty way
of snapping at her nose, not meaning anything,
but it got on her nerves dreadfully—and when I
mounted Pixie and shook my crop at him, he would
stand up at the end of his chain, his fore paws
beating the air and his tongue hanging out, because
he was choking himself so hard; and I’ve often
thought he looked more unattractive that way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
his one head than any picture of Cerberus with
three.</p>

<p>“It was particularly hard on him now that his
cat was dead. We had got him a new kitten, but
it wasn’t broken in yet, and couldn’t understand
that he didn’t mean anything when he carried it
around in his mouth.</p>

<p>“It was that evening that I saw the gray collie
the first time. There were long streaks of late
sunlight reaching up into the mountain and he was
so mixed up in the light and shadow that it was
only by chance I saw him at all, he was so like the
tree trunks and bowlders; but he happened to be
in a place that I knew all about, because it was
where papa and I had often sat, and I knew no
gray patch of anything belonged just there. It
was like finding an animal in one of those old puzzle-pictures,
where they’re all mixed up in the
branches.</p>

<p>“I reined up and whistled, and called him every
name I could think of, but he did not stir, so that
I almost thought my eyes were wrong after all;
but there was no mistaking those pointed ears
cocked toward me. I thought he might be the
sheep-killer, though he was such an aristocratic
creature, for what can you expect of a dog that’s
lost and hungry and unhappy? I’d probably steal
something myself if I felt that way. I knew that
nobody in our part of the country owned such a
dog as that, and I wondered if his master were
dead up there on the mountain. There are so many
queer accidents—but it was the closed season. The
more I wondered, the queerer it seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“All of a sudden, Pixie snorted and plunged so
that I was almost thrown, for I wasn’t expecting
it, and was leaning over with a loose rein and my
arm out toward the collie. I had trusted that mare
like my own sister, and had believed her a sensible
soul, but she never stopped until she reached the
barn, sweating and trembling like anything.</p>

<p>“I was so out of patience that I left her at home
with Artie the next time I went for the mail. I
planned as I went through the woods how I would
make the collie’s acquaintance and bring him home,
and how he and Artie would strike up a friendship.
They were both such splendid fellows and so lonely.
I thought a good deal about it, how I’d manage,
for I knew that if I wasn’t careful they’d be more
likely to kill each other first—like Balin and Balan,
you know—and make up afterward.</p>

<p>“I didn’t meet the collie until I was coming back.
It was twilight, and the moon was rather narrow
to see by. There was a rustle and snapping in the
bushes at the side of the road.</p>

<p>“‘Nice fellow!’ I said, and stopped. I could
make out the silhouette of his ears cocked toward
me, and a little glimmer where his eyes were.
‘Poor old chap,’ I said, ‘did you lose your folks?’
But he wouldn’t say a word, and backed off when
I went toward him, so finally I went on, hoping he
would follow, and he did, but slyly, so I could
hardly be sure it was he, keeping beside me in the
underbrush.</p>

<p>“When I reached the open, and looked back, he
was standing in a faint patch of moonlight, in the
middle of the road, looking after me with his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
down a little, something the way people look at you
under their eyebrows when they’re trying to understand.</p>

<p>“I whistled and called, but it was no use. He
stood there as long as I did, and I finally went on
without him. But I couldn’t get him off my mind.
It seemed such a wild, lonesome life for a dog that
must have been brought up in a pleasant home,
with regular meals and a fireplace to lie in front of,
and probably a girl like me to take him walking.
And it seemed as if it must be something queer
and tragic to send him off that way by himself. I
thought more and more how some young fellow
might be lying dead up there on the mountain. I
made up a whole story about it that evening. And
that night I dreamed I had the collie and found a
collar hidden in his ruff, and was trying to read
his name on it—but you know how hard it is to
read anything in a dream; you look at a letter and
it changes to something else, or dances off to one
side. Then he seemed to be telling me a long story,
the way animals do in dreams, but when I woke up
it turned into nonsense.</p>

<p>“I knew he would meet me the next evening,
and so I took some of Artie’s dog-biscuit with me,
and while the collie padded along the other side of
the bushes, tried to reach some through to him, but
he wouldn’t touch it, though once he sniffed a little
very daintily, and then blew out his breath, as dogs
do when they’ve found out all they want to know
about a smell. He kept right beside me. As we
neared the opening he grew bolder, frisked across
the road in front and came up from the other side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
As I pretended to pay no attention, he came close
behind and touched my elbow, hardly enough to
say so, but I felt his breath warm through my
sleeve.</p>

<p>“When I came out into the open moonlight he
stood as he had before at the edge of the woods,
and watched me out of sight. I couldn’t believe
that he was the sheep-killer, he seemed so gentle
and timid, but I didn’t dare speak of him to any
one—it would have seemed like betraying a trust—for
I knew that in other people’s minds, if they
found out that he was there, it would lie between
him and Artie, and as Artie was out of the question,
they would take it out in killing the collie
anyhow. I felt something the way Southern girls
do in novels, when they’re hiding a handsome Union
soldier.</p>

<p>“The next evening I started as usual, but just
as I got to the woods, Artie came tearing after
me, dragging a yard of chain and pretending he
thought I wanted him! I could have slapped him,
but took it out in being sarcastic, with words he
couldn’t understand, and hitched his chain to
my belt, so that if he started to be impolite to
the other fellow, I could have something to say
about it.</p>

<p>“We reached the post-office safely enough, but
I was glad he was tight to my belt, for some rough
men looked at us in that ugly, suspicious way and
said ‘sheep-killer’ once or twice, and ‘loup-garou.’
So I really felt safer when we reached the woods,
in spite of dreading the meeting between Artie
and the collie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I didn’t hear or see anything of him until
we were half-way through, and then, so far off it
might have been on top of the mountain, I heard
him howl—not exactly a howl, but a queer cry, as
if he were calling to something at a distance, kind
of sorrowful, but fierce, too. It went down my
back like a chip of ice—but I’d hardly heard it
when Artie roared in answer, and I was being carried
up that mountain at the end of his chain like
a cart after a runaway horse.</p>

<p>“And I had thought I could hold him! Gracious!
I tried to catch at the branches, but they broke.
We went through a patch of blackberries, and there
was a mucky little spring, where I fell in the mud
and scared the frogs, and I think it must have been
half-way up Phelim, where I finally caught tight
hold of a tree trunk and my belt broke and Artie
went on as if he didn’t know the difference. I
don’t know how long it was before I got my breath
and began to think. Then I heard them—away
off at the top, the frogs singing between as peaceful
as could be—but I heard that wicked snarling
and knew they were at it—Balin and Balan—and
that they were so well matched it was likely to be
the death of both, unless I could stop it. I followed
the sound and climbed after, though I was all weak
and trembling. You can see on my hands now how
the thorns had scratched, and my clothes were
heavy and sticky with mud. It seemed ages before
I got there. I think I was crying.</p>

<p>“I knew I couldn’t do anything, but I picked
up the heaviest stick I could find, though all the
sticks you can pick up in the woods are as rotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and light as powder. They didn’t seem to know I
was there. They were in a little open space, and
the moonlight lit up their eyes now and then. I
could see that the collie was a more tremendous
fellow than I had thought—and then—all of a sudden—I
knew!</p>

<p>“And because I knew I didn’t even try to pull
Artie away when he got the other fellow by the
throat, and held him down, while he got weaker
and weaker. I looked at him there in the moonlight,
and cried, and wondered how I’d been so
stupid.</p>

<p>“While I sat there wringing my hands and waiting
for Artie to let go, some men came up and
turned a bull’s-eye lantern on me, and seemed so
astonished they couldn’t do anything but swear,
though each would try to shut the other up, now
and then, saying there ‘was a lady present.’</p>

<p>“One of them seemed to think it was funny, and
explained what they had said to each other, the
way people always do for animals or babies. ‘Siberian
wolf and Siberian wolf-hound! Must ’a
seemed kin’ o’ natural for them fellers to meet up.
‘Beg pardon,’ says the wolf, ‘ain’t I seen you before?’—and
says the pup, ‘I don’t know, but you’re
certainly the chap my mammy told me to lick if
ever I come acrost you, and, by thunder, I’ll do
it!’ Which he did. ‘Will you be so kind, Miss,
when your little terrier there has quite finished, to
call him off? It’d be rayther indelicate for a
stranger to interfere.’</p>

<p>“The other man seemed sorry. ‘Nothing left
but his pelt, which is some chewed, but could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
mended up into a real elegant rug, which the young
lady might be pleased to accept.’”</p>

<p>Henrietta thoughtfully scratched the ears of the
rug, and ran her fingers over the rows of beautiful
teeth. “This is the collie.”</p>

<p>“But sometimes I wonder just what he had in
mind when I felt his breath on my elbow. Most
people would say that he was thinking how convenient
I would be some evening when no sheep
was handy, but I’m not sure. At the time I supposed
he was sad and lonesome, and glad of my
company. A wolf, after all, is a good deal of a
person. He was so frightfully solitary, you see—nobody
to answer his gathering cry—half a world
away from his own people.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_FORE-ROOM_RUG">THE FORE-ROOM RUG</h2>

<p class="author">By Kate Douglas Wiggin</p>

<p class="dropcap">Diadema, wife of Jot Bascom, was sitting
at the window of the village watch-tower, so
called because it commanded a view of nearly
everything that happened in Pleasant River; those
details escaping the physical eye being supplied by
faith and imagination working in the light of past
experience. She sat in the chair of honor, the chair
of choice, the high-backed rocker by the southern
window, in which her husband’s mother, old Mrs.
Bascom, had sat for thirty years, applying a still
more powerful intellectual telescope to the doings
of her neighbors. Diadema’s seat had formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
been on the less desirable side of the little light-stand,
where Priscilla Hollis was now installed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bascom was at work on a new fore-room
rug, the former one having been transferred to
Miss Hollis’s chamber; for, as the teacher at the
brick schoolhouse, a graduate of a Massachusetts
normal school and the daughter of a deceased
judge, she was a boarder of considerable consequence.
It was a rainy Saturday afternoon, and the
two women were alone. It was a pleasant, peaceful
sitting-room, as neat as wax in every part. The
floor was covered by a cheerful patriotic rag carpet
woven entirely of red, white, and blue rags, and
protected in various exposed localities by button
rugs—red, white, and blue disks superimposed one
on the other.</p>

<p>Diadema Bascom was a person of some sentiment.
When her old father, Captain Dennett,
was dying, he drew a wallet from under his pillow,
and handed her a twenty-dollar bill to get something
to remember him by. This unwonted occurrence
burned itself into the daughter’s imagination,
and when she came as a bride to the Bascom house
she refurnished the sitting-room as a kind of monument
to the departed soldier, whose sword and
musket were now tied to the wall with neatly
hemmed bows of bright red cotton.</p>

<p>The chair cushions were of red-and-white glazed
patch, the turkey wings that served as hearth
brushes were hung against the white-painted chimney-piece
with blue skirt braid, and the white
shades were finished with home-made scarlet “tossels.”
A little whatnot in one corner was laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
with the trophies of battle. The warrior’s brass
buttons were strung on a red picture cord and hung
over his daguerreotype on the upper shelf; there
was a tarnished shoulder strap, and a flattened bullet
that the captain’s jealous contemporaries swore
<em>he</em> never stopped, unless he got it in the rear when
he was flying from the foe. There was also a little
tin canister in which a charge of powder had been
sacredly preserved. The scoffers, again, said that
“the cap’n put it in his musket when he went into
the war, and kep’ it there till he come out.” These
objects were tastefully decorated with the national
colors. In fact, no modern æsthete could have arranged
a symbolic symphony of grief and glory
with any more fidelity to an ideal than Diadema
Bascom, in working out her scheme of red, white,
and blue.</p>

<p>Rows of ripening tomatoes lay along the ledges
of the windows, and a tortoiseshell cat snoozed on
one of the broad sills. The tall clock in the corner
ticked peacefully. Priscilla Hollis never tired of
looking at the jolly red-cheeked moon, the group
of stars on a blue ground, the trig little ship, the
old house, and the jolly moon again, creeping one
after another across the open space at the top.</p>

<p>Jot Bascom was out, as usual, gathering statistics
of the last horse trade; little Jot was building
“stickin’” houses in the barn; Priscilla was sewing
long strips for braiding; while Diadema sat at the
drawing-in frame, hook in hand, and a large basket
of cut rags by her side.</p>

<p>Not many weeks before she had paid one of her
periodical visits to the attic. No housekeeper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Pleasant River save Mrs. Jonathan Bascom would
have thought of dusting a garret, washing the window
and sweeping down the cobwebs once a month,
and renewing the camphor bags in the chests twice
a year; but notwithstanding this zealous care the
moths had made their way into one of her treasure-houses,
the most precious of all—the old hair trunk
that had belonged to her sister Lovice. Once ensconced
there, they had eaten through its hoarded
relics, and reduced the faded finery to a state best
described by Diadema as “reg’lar riddlin’ sieves.”
She had brought the tattered pile down into the
kitchen, and had spent a tearful afternoon in cutting
the good pieces from the perforated garments.
Three heaped-up baskets and a full dish-pan were
the result; and as she had snipped and cut and
sorted, one of her sentimental projects had entered
her mind and taken complete possession
there.</p>

<p>“I declare,” she said, as she drew her hooking-needle
in and out, “I wouldn’t set in the room with
some folks and work on these pieces; for every time
I draw in a scrap of cloth Lovice comes up to me
for all the world as if she was settin’ on the sofy
there. I ain’t told you my plan, Miss Hollis, and
there ain’t many I shall tell; but this rug is going
to be a kind of a hist’ry of my life and Lovey’s
wrought in together, just as we was bound up in
one another when she was alive. Her things and
mine was laid in one trunk, and the moths sha’n’t
cheat me out of ’em altogether. If I can’t look at
’em wet Sundays, and shake ’em out, and have a
good cry over ’em, I’ll make ’em up into a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
dumb show that will mean something to me, if it
don’t to anybody else.</p>

<p>“We was the youngest of thirteen, Lovey and I,
and we was twins. There’s never been more’n half
o’ me left sence she died. We was born together,
played and went to school together, got engaged
and married together, and we all but died together,
yet we wa’n’t a mite alike. There was an old lady
come to our house once that used to say, ‘There’s
sister Nabby, now: she’n’ I ain’t no more alike ’n
if we wa’n’t two; she’s jest as dif’rent as I am
t’other way.’ Well, I know what I want to put into
my rag story, Miss Hollis, but I don’t hardly know
how to begin.”</p>

<p>Priscilla dropped her needle, and bent over the
frame with interest.</p>

<p>“A spray of two roses in the center—there’s the
beginning; why, don’t you see, dear Mrs. Bascom?”</p>

<p>“Course I do,” said Diadema, diving to the bottom
of the dish-pan. “I’ve got my start now, and
don’t you say a word for a minute. The two roses
grow out of one stalk; they’ll be Lovey and me,
though I’m consid’able more like a potato blossom.
The stalk’s got to be green, and here is the very
green silk mother walked bride in, and Lovey and I
had roundabouts of it afterwards. She had the
chicken-pox when we was about four years old, and
one of the first things I can remember is climbing
up and looking over mother’s footboard at Lovey,
all speckled. Mother had let her slip on her new
green roundabout over her nightgown, just to pacify
her, and there she set playing with the kitten
Reuben Granger had brought her. He was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
ten years old then, but he’d begun courting Lovice.
The Grangers’ farm joined ours. They had eleven
children, and mother and father had thirteen,
and we was always playing together. Mother
used to tell a funny story about that. We were
all little young ones and looked pretty much alike,
so she didn’t take much notice of us in the daytime
when we was running out ’n’ in; but at night, when
the turn-up bedstead in the kitchen was taken down
and the trundle-beds were full, she used to count
us over, to see if we were all there. One night,
when she’d counted thirteen and set down to her
sewing, father come in and asked if Moses was all
right, for one of the neighbors had seen him playing
side of the river about supper-time. Mother
knew she’d counted us straight, but she went round
with a candle to make sure. Now, Mr. Granger
had a head as red as a sumac bush; and when she
carried the candle close to the beds to take another
tally, there was thirteen children, sure enough, but
if there wa’n’t a red-headed Granger right in
amongst our boys in the turn-up bedstead! While
father set out on a hunt for our Moses, mother
yanked the sleepy little red-headed Granger out o’
the middle and took him home, and father found
Moses asleep on a pile of shavings under the joiner’s
bench.</p>

<p>“They don’t have such families nowadays. One
time when measles went all over the village, they
never came to us, and Jabe Slocum said there
wa’n’t enough measles to go through the Dennett
family, so they didn’t start in on ’em. There, I
ain’t going to finish the stalk; I’m going to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in a little here and there all over the rug, while I’m
in the sperit of plannin’ it, and then it will be plain
work of matching colors and filling out.</p>

<p>“You see the stalk is mother’s dress, and the outside
green of the moss roses is the same goods, only
it’s our roundabouts. I meant to make ’em red,
when I marked the pattern, and then fill out round
’em with a light color; but now I ain’t satisfied with
anything but white, for nothing will do in the middle
of the rug but our white wedding dresses. I
shall have to fill in dark, then, or mixed. Well,
that won’t be out of the way, if it’s going to be a
true rag story; for Lovey’s life went out altogether,
and mine hasn’t been any too gay.</p>

<p>“I’ll begin Lovey’s rose first. She was the prettiest
and the liveliest girl in the village, and she
had more beaux than you could shake a stick at.
I generally had to take what she left over. Reuben
Granger was crazy about her from the time she
was knee-high; but when he went away to Bangor
to study for the ministry, the others had it all their
own way. She was only seventeen; she hadn’t ever
experienced religion, and she was mischievous as a
kitten.</p>

<p>“You remember you laughed, this morning,
when Mr. Bascom told about Hogshead Jowett?
Well, he used to want to keep company with
Lovey; but she couldn’t abide him, and whenever
he come to court her she clim’ into a hogshead, and
hid till after he’d gone. The boys found it out, and
used to call him ‘Hogshead Jowett.’ He was the
biggest fool in Foxboro’ Four Corners; and that’s
saying consid’able, for Foxboro’ is famous for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
fools, and always has been. There was thirteen of
’em there one year. They say a man come out from
Portland, and when he got as fur as Foxboro’ he
kep’ inquiring the way to Dunstan; and I declare
if he didn’t meet them thirteen fools, one after another,
standing in their front dooryards ready to
answer questions. When he got to Dunstan, says
he, ‘For the Lord’s sake, what kind of a village is
it that I’ve just went through? Be they <em>all</em> fools
there?’</p>

<p>“Hogshead was scairt to death whenever he
come to see Lovice. One night, when he’d been
there once, and she’d hid, as she always done, he
come back a second time, and she went to the door,
not mistrusting it was him. ‘Did you forget anything?’
says she, sparkling out at him through a
little crack. He was all taken aback by seeing her,
and he stammered out, ‘Yes, I forgot my han’k’chief;
but it don’t make no odds, for I didn’t pay
out but fifteen cents for it two year ago, and I
don’t make no use of it ’ceptins to wipe my nose
on.’ How we did laugh over that! Well, he had a
conviction of sin pretty soon afterwards, and p’r’aps
it helped his head some; at any rate, he quit
farming, and become a Bullockite preacher.</p>

<p>“It seems odd, when Lovice wa’n’t a perfessor
herself, she should have drawed the most pious
young men in the village, but she did; she had good
Orthodox beaux, Free and Close Baptists, Millerites
and Adventists, all on her string together; she even
had one Cochranite, though the sect had mostly died
out. But when Reuben Granger come home, a full-feathered-out
minister, he seemed to strike her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
fancy as he never had before, though they were
always good friends from children. He had light
hair and blue eyes and fair skin (his business being
under cover kep’ him bleached out), and he and
Lovey made the prettiest couple you ever see; for
she was dark complexioned, and her cheeks no otherways
than scarlit the whole durin’ time. She had
a change of heart that winter; in fact, she had two
of ’em, for she changed hers for Reuben’s, and
found a hope at the same time. ’Twas a good, honest
conversion, too, though she did say to me she
was afraid that if Reuben hadn’t taught her what
love was or might be, she’d never have found out
enough about it to love God as she’d ought to.</p>

<p>“There, I’ve begun both roses, and hers is ’bout
finished. I sha’n’t have more’n enough white alapaca.
It’s lucky the moths spared one breadth of
the wedding dresses; we was married on the same
day, you know, and dressed just alike. Jot wa’n’t
quite ready to be married, for he wa’n’t any more
forehanded ’bout that than he was ’bout other
things; but I told him Lovey and I had kept up
with each other from the start, and he’d got to fall
into line or drop out of the percession. Now what
next?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there anybody at the wedding but you
and Lovice?” asked Priscilla, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“Land, yes! The meeting-house was cram jam
full. Oh, to be sure! I know what you’re driving
at! Well, I have to laugh to think I should have
forgot the husbands! They’ll have to be worked
into the story, certain; but it’ll be consid’able of a
chore, for I can’t make flowers out of coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
pants stuff, and there ain’t any more flowers on
this branch, anyway.”</p>

<p>Diadema sat for a few minutes in rapt thought,
and then made a sudden inspired dash upstairs,
where Miss Hollis presently heard her rummaging
in an old chest. She soon came down, triumphant.</p>

<p>“Wa’n’t it a providence I saved Jot’s and Reuben’s
wedding ties! And here they are—one yellow
and green mixed, and one brown. Do you
know what I’m going to do? I’m going to draw
in a butterfly hovering over them two roses, and
make it out of the neckties—green with brown
spots. That’ll bring in the husbands; and land! I
wouldn’t have either of ’em know it for the world.
I’ll take a pattern of that lunar moth you pinned
on the curtain yesterday.”</p>

<p>Miss Hollis smiled in spite of herself. “You
have some very ingenious ideas and some very
pretty thoughts, Mrs. Bascom, do you know it?”</p>

<p>“It’s the first time I ever heard tell of it,” said
Diadema cheerfully. “Lovey was the pretty-spoken,
pretty-appearing one; I was always plain
and practical. While I think of it, I’ll draw in a
little mite of this red into my carnation pink. It
was a red scarf Reuben brought Lovey from Portland.
It was the first thing he ever give her, and
aunt Hitty said if one of the Abel Grangers give
away anything that cost money, it meant business.
That was all fol-de-rol, for there never was a more
liberal husband, though he was a poor minister; but
then they always <em>are</em> poor, without they’re rich;
there don’t seem to be any half-way in ministers.</p>

<p>“We was both lucky that way. There ain’t a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
stingy bone in Jot Bascom’s body. He don’t make
much money, but what he does make goes into the
bureau drawer, and the one that needs it most takes
it out. He never asks me what I done with the last
five cents he give me. You’ve never been married,
Miss Hollis, and you ain’t engaged, so you
don’t know much about it; but I tell you there’s a
heap o’ foolishness talked about husbands. If you
get the one you like yourself, I don’t know as it
matters if all the other women folks in town don’t
happen to like him as well as you do; they ain’t
called on to do that. They see the face he turns to
them, not the one he turns to you. Jot ain’t a very
good provider, nor he ain’t a man that’s much use
round a farm, but he’s such a fav’rite I can’t blame
him. There’s one thing: when he does come home
he’s got something to say, and he’s always as lively
as a cricket, and smiling as a basket of chips. I like
a man that’s good comp’ny, even if he ain’t so forehanded.
There ain’t anything specially lovable
about forehandedness, when you come to that. I
shouldn’t ever feel drawed to a man because he was
on time with his work. He’s got such pleasant
ways, Jot has! The other afternoon he didn’t get
home early enough to milk; and after I done the
two cows, I split the kindling and brought in the
wood, for I knew he’d want to go to the tavern and
tell the boys ’bout the robbery up to Boylston.
There ain’t anybody but Jot in this village that has
wit enough to find out what’s going on, and tell it
in an int’resting way round the tavern fire. And
he can do it without being full of cider, too; he don’t
need any apple juice to limber <em>his</em> tongue!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, when he come in, he sees the pails of milk,
and the full wood-box, and the supper laid out under
the screen cloth on the kitchen table, and he
come up to me at the sink, and says he, ‘Diademy,
you’re the best wife in this county, and the brightest
jewel in my crown—that’s what <em>you</em> are!’ (He
got that idee out of a duet he sings with Almiry
Berry.) Now I’d like to know whether that ain’t
pleasanter than ’tis to have a man do all the shed ’n’
barn work up smart, and then set round the stove
looking as doleful as a last year’s bird’s-nest? Take
my advice, Miss Hollis: get a good provider if you
can, but anyhow try to find you a husband that’ll
keep on courting a little now and then, when he
ain’t too busy; it smooths things consid’able round
the house.</p>

<p>“There, I got so int’rested in what I was saying,
I’ve went on and finished the carnation, and some
of the stem, too. Now what comes next? Why,
the thing that happened next, of course, and that
was little Jot.</p>

<p>“I’ll work in a bud on my rose and one on
Lovey’s, and my bud’ll be made of Jot’s first
trousers. The goods ain’t very appropriate for a
rosebud, but it’ll be mostly covered with green on
the outside, and it’ll have to do, for the idee is the
most important thing in this rug. When I put him
into pants, I hadn’t any cloth in the house, and it
was such bad going Jot couldn’t get to Wareham to
buy me anything; so I made ’em out of an old gray
cashmere skirt, and lined ’em with flannel.”</p>

<p>“Buds are generally the same color as the roses,
aren’t they?” ventured Priscilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care if they be,” said Diadema obstinately.
“What’s to hender this bud’s bein’ grafted
on? Mrs. Granger was as black as an Injun, but
the little Granger children were all red-headed, for
they took after their father. But I don’t know;
you’ve kind o’ got me out o’ conceit with it. I s’pose
I could have taken a piece of his baby blanket; but
the moths never et a mite o’ that, and it’s too good
to cut up. There’s one thing I can do: I can make
the bud with a long stem, and have it growing right
up alongside of mine—would you?”</p>

<p>“No, it must be stalk of your stalk, bone of your
bone, flesh of your flesh, so to speak. I agree with
you, the idea is the first thing. Besides, the gray is
a very light shade, and I dare say it will look like
a bluish white.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try it and see; but I wish to the land the
moths <em>had</em> eat the pinning-blanket, and then I could
have used it. Lovey worked the scallops on the
aidge for me. My grief! what int’rest she took in
my baby clothes! Little Jot was born at Thanksgiving
time, and she come over from Skowhegan,
where Reuben was settled pastor of his first church.
I shall never forget them two weeks to the last day
of my life. There was deep snow on the ground.
I had that chamber there, with the door opening
into this setting-room. Mother and father Bascom
kep’ out in the dining-room and kitchen, where the
work was going on, and Lovey and the baby and
me had the front part of the house to ourselves, with
Jot coming in on tiptoe, heaping up wood in the
fireplaces so ’t he ’most roasted us out. He don’t
forget his chores in time o’ sickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never took so much comfort in all my days.
Jot got one of the Billings girls to come over and
help in the housework so ’t I could lay easy ’s long
as I wanted to; and I never had such a rest before
nor since. There ain’t any heaven in the book o’
Revelations that’s any better than them two weeks
was. I used to lay quiet in my good feather bed,
fingering the pattern of my best crochet quilt, and
looking at the fire-light shining on Lovey and the
baby. She’d hardly leave him in the cradle a minute.
When I didn’t want him in bed with me, she’d
have him in her lap. Babies are common enough to
most folks, but Lovey was diff’rent. She’d never
had any experience with children, either, for we was
the youngest in our family; and it wa’n’t long before
we come near being the oldest, too, for mother
buried seven of us before she went herself. Anyway,
I never saw nobody else look as she done when
she held my baby. I don’t mean nothing blasphemious
when I say ’twas for all the world like your
photograph of Mary, the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>“The nights come in early, so it was ’most dark
at four o’clock. The little chamber was so peaceful!
I could hear Jot rattling the milk-pails, but
I’d draw a deep breath o’ comfort, for I knew the
milk would be strained and set away without my
stepping foot to the floor. Lovey used to set by the
fire, with a tall candle on the light-stand behind her,
and a little white knit cape over her shoulders. She
had the pinkest cheeks, and the longest eyelashes,
and a mouth like a little red buttonhole; and when
she bent over the baby, and sung to him—though
his ears wa’n’t open, I guess, for his eyes wa’n’t—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
tears o’ joy used to rain down my cheeks. It
was pennyrial hymns she used to sing mostly, and
the one I remember best was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“‘Daniel’s wisdom may I know,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>“‘Oh, Diademy,’ she’d say, ‘you was always the
best, and it’s nothing more’n right the baby should
have come to you. P’r’aps God will think I’m good
enough some time; and if he does, Diademy, I’ll
offer up a sacrifice every morning and every evening.
But I’m afraid,’ says she, ‘He thinks I can’t
stand any more happiness, and be a faithful follower
of the cross. The Bible says we’ve got to
wade through fiery floods before we can enter the
kingdom. I don’t hardly know how Reuben and I
are going to find any to wade through; we’re both
so happy, they’d have to be consid’able hot before
we took notice, says she, with the dimples all breaking
out in her cheek.</p>

<p>“And that was true as gospel. She thought
everything Reuben done was just right, and he
thought everything she done was just right. There
wa’n’t nobody else; the world was all Reuben ’n’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
all Lovey to them. If you could have seen her
when she was looking for him to come from Skowhegan!
She used to watch at the attic window; and
when she seen him at the foot of the hill, she’d up
like a squirrel, and run down the road without
stopping for anything but to throw a shawl over
her head. And Reuben would ketch her up as if
she was a child, and scold her for not putting a hat
on, and take her under his coat coming up the hill.
They was a sight for the neighbors, I must confess,
but it wa’n’t one you could hardly disapprove
of neither. Aunt Hitty said it was tempting Providence
and couldn’t last, and God would visit his
wrath on ’em for making idols of sinful human
flesh.</p>

<p>“She was right one way—it didn’t last; but nobody
can tell me God was punishing of ’em for being
too happy. I guess he ain’t got no objection to
folks being happy here below, if they don’t forget it
ain’t the whole story.</p>

<p>“Well, I must mark in a bud on Lovey’s stalk
now, and I’m going to make it of her baby’s long
white cloak. I earned the money for it myself, making
coats, and put four yards of the finest cashmere
into it; for three years after little Jot was born I
went over to Skowhegan to help Lovey through her
time o’ trial. Time o’ trial! I thought I was happy,
but I didn’t know how to be as happy as Lovey did;
I wa’n’t made on that pattern.</p>

<p>“When I first showed her the baby (it was a boy,
same as mine), her eyes shone like two evening
stars. She held up her weak arms, and gathered
the little bundle o’ warm flannel into ’em; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
she got it close she shut her eyes and moved her
lips, and I knew she was taking her lamb to the
altar and off’ring it up as a sacrifice. Then Reuben
come in. I seen him give one look at the two
dark heads laying close together on the white piller,
and then go down on his knees by the side of the
bed. ’Twa’n’t no place for me; I went off, and
left ’em together. We didn’t mistrust it then, but
they only had three days more of happiness, and
I’m glad I give ’em every minute.”</p>

<p>The room grew dusky as twilight stole gently
over the hills of Pleasant River. Priscilla’s lip
trembled; Diadema’s tears fell thick and fast on the
white rosebud, and she had to keep wiping her eyes
as she followed the pattern.</p>

<p>“I ain’t said as much as this about it for five
years,” she went on, with a tell-tale quiver in
her voice, “but now I’ve got going, I can’t stop.
I’ll have to get the weight out o’ my heart somehow.</p>

<p>“Three days after I put Lovey’s baby into her
arms the Lord called her home. ‘When I prayed
so hard for this little new life, Reuben,’ says she,
holding the baby as if she could never let it go, ‘I
didn’t think I’d got to give up my own in place of
it; but it’s the first fiery flood we’ve had, dear, and
though it burns to my feet I’ll tread it as brave as
I know how.’</p>

<p>“She didn’t speak a word after that; she just
faded away like a snowdrop, hour by hour. And
Reuben and I stared one another in the face as if
we was dead instead of her, and we went about that
house o’ mourning like sleep-walkers for days and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
days, not knowing whether we et or slept, or what
we done.</p>

<p>“As for the baby, the poor little mite didn’t live
many hours after its mother, and we buried ’em
together. Reuben and I knew what Lovey would
have liked. She gave her life for the baby’s, and
it was a useless sacrifice, after all. No, it wa’n’t
neither; it <em>couldn’t</em> have been! You needn’t tell
me God’ll let such sacrifices as that come out useless!
But anyhow, we had one coffin for ’em both,
and I opened Lovey’s arms and laid the baby in
’em. When Reuben and I took our last look, we
thought she seemed more’n ever like Mary, the
mother of Jesus. There never was another like
her, and there never will be. ‘Nonesuch,’ Reuben
used to call her.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the room, broken only by
the ticking of the old clock and the tinkle of a distant
cowbell. Priscilla made an impetuous movement,
flung herself down by the basket of rags, and
buried her head in Diadema’s gingham apron.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Bascom, don’t cry. I’m sorry, as
the children say.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t more’n a minute. Jot can’t stand
it to see me give way. You go and touch a match
to the kitchen fire, so ’t the kettle will be boiling,
and I’ll have a minute to myself. I don’t know
what the neighbors would think to ketch me crying
over my drawing-in frame; but the spell’s over now,
or ’bout over, and when I can muster up courage
I’ll take the rest of the baby’s cloak and put a border
of white everlastings round the outside of the
rug. It’ll always mean the baby’s birth and Lovey’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
death to me; but the flowers will remind me it’s life
everlasting for both of ’em, and so it’s the most
comforting end I can think of.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a beautiful rug when it was finished
and laid in front of the sofa in the fore-room.
Diadema was very choice of it. When company
was expected, she removed it from its accustomed
place, and spread it in a corner of the room where
no profane foot could possibly tread on it. Unexpected
callers were managed by a different method.
If they seated themselves on the sofa, she would
fear they did not “set easy” or “rest comfortable”
there, and suggest their moving to the stuffed chair
by the window. The neighbors thought this solicitude
merely another sign of Diadema’s “p’ison neatness,”
excusable in this case, as there was so much
white in the new rug.</p>

<p>The fore-room blinds were ordinarily closed, and
the chillness of death pervaded the sacred apartment;
but on great occasions, when the sun was allowed
to penetrate the thirty-two tiny panes of
glass in each window, and a blaze was lighted in
the fireplace, Miss Hollis would look in as she
went upstairs, and muse a moment over the pathetic
little romance of rags, the story of two lives worked
into a bouquet of old-fashioned posies, whose gay
tints were brought out by a setting of somber
threads. Existence had gone so quietly in this remote
corner of the world that all its important
events, babyhood, childhood, betrothal, marriage,
motherhood, with all their mysteries of love and life
and death, were chronicled in this narrow space not
two yards square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Diadema came in behind the little school-teacher
one afternoon.</p>

<p>“I cal’late,” she said, “that being kep’ in a dark
room, and never being tread on, it will last longer
’n I do. If it does, Priscilla, you know that white
crape shawl of mine I wear to meetings hot Sundays:
that would make a second row of everlastings
round the border. You could piece out the linings
good and smooth on the under side, draw in the
white flowers, and fill ’em round with black to set
’em off. The rug would be han’somer than ever
then, and the story—would be finished.”</p>

<h2 id="CRESSYS_NEW-YEARS_RENT">CRESSY’S NEW-YEAR’S RENT</h2>

<p class="author">By Albert Lee</p>

<p class="dropcap">Fred Hallowell was sitting at his desk
in the <cite>Gazette</cite> office, looking listlessly out
into the City Hall Park, where the biting wind
was making the snowflakes dance madly around
the leafless trees and in the empty fountain, and
he was almost wishing that there would be so few
assignments to cover as to allow him an afternoon
indoors to write “specials.” The storm was the
worst of the season, and as this was the last day of
December, it looked as if the old year were going
out with a tumultuous train of sleet and snow. But
if he had seriously entertained any hopes of enjoying
a quiet day, these were dispelled by an office-boy
who summoned him to the city desk.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Hallowell,” said the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
editor, cheerfully. “Here is a clipping from an
afternoon paper which says that a French family
in Houston Street has been dispossessed and is in
want. Mr. Wilson called my attention to it because
he thinks, from the number given, the house
belongs to old Q. C. Baggold. We don’t like Baggold,
you know, and if you find he is treating his
tenants unfairly we can let you have all the space
you want to show him up. At any rate, go over
there and see what the trouble is; there is not much
going on to-day.”</p>

<p>Fred took the clipping and read it as he walked
back to his desk. It was very short—five or six
lines only—and the facts stated were about as the
city editor had said. The young man got into his
overcoat and wrapped himself up warmly, and in
a few moments was himself battling against the
little blizzard with the other pedestrians whom he
had been watching in the City Hall Park from the
office windows.</p>

<p>When he reached Houston Street he travelled
westward for several blocks, until he came into a
very poor district crowded with dingy tenement-houses
that leaned against one another in an uneven
sort of way, as if they were tired of the sad
kind of life they had been witnessing for so many
years. The snow that had piled up on the window-sills
and over the copings seemed to brighten up
the general aspect of the quarter, because it filled
in the cracks and chinks of material misery, and
made the buildings look at least temporarily picturesque,
just as paint and powder for a time may
hide the traces of old age and sorrow. Fred found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the number 179 painted on a piece of tin that had
become bent and rusty from long service over a
narrow doorway, and as he stood there comparing
it with the number given in his clipping, a little
girl with a shawl drawn tightly over her head and
around her thin little shoulders came out of the
dark entrance and stopped on the door-sill for a
moment, surprised, no doubt, at the sight of the
tall rosy-cheeked young man so warmly clad in a
big woollen overcoat that you could have wrapped
her up in several times, with goods left over to
spare.</p>

<p>“Hello! little girl,” said Fred, quickly. “Does
Mr. Cressy live here?”</p>

<p>The child stared for a few seconds at the
stranger, and then she answered, bashfully: “Yes,
sir. But he has got to go away.”</p>

<p>“But he hasn’t gone yet?” continued Fred; and
then noticing that the child, in her short calico
skirt, was shivering from the cold, and that her
feet were getting wet with the snow, he added,
“Come inside a minute and tell me where I can
find Mr. Cressy.”</p>

<p>The two stepped into the dark narrow hallway
that ran through the house to the stairway in the
rear, where a narrow window with a broken pane
let in just enough light to prove there was day outside.
The little girl leaned against the wall, and
looked up at the reporter as if she suspected him
of having no good intentions toward the man for
whom he was inquiring. Very few strangers ever
came into that house to do good, she knew. Most
of them came for money—rent money—and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
they came, as a man had come for Mr. Cressy,
to tell him he must go.</p>

<p>“What floor does he live on?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“On the fifth floor, sir,” answered the child. “In
the back, sir. But I think he is really going away,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, no matter about that,” said Fred, smiling.
“I will go up and see him. I hope he won’t
have to go out in the storm. It is not good for
little girls to go out in the storm, either,” he added.
“Does your mamma know you are going out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! She has sent me to the Sisters to
try to get some medicine.”</p>

<p>“Is she sick?” asked Fred, quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” continued the child.</p>

<p>“What floor does she live on? I will stop in and
see her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll see her! She’s in the room, too.”</p>

<p>“Then you are Mr. Cressy’s little girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>So Fred patted her on the head and told her to
hurry over to the Sisters in Eleventh Street, and
gave her ten cents to ride in the horse-cars; and
then he opened the door for her, and as soon as she
had left he felt his way back to the staircase and
climbed to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>There he knocked upon a door, which was soon
opened by a man apparently forty years of age, a
man of slightly foreign appearance, with a careworn
look, but with as honest a face as you could
find anywhere.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Cressy?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, my name’s Cressy,” replied the man. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
spoke with so slight an accent that it was hardly
noticeable.</p>

<p>“I am a reporter from the <cite>Gazette</cite>,” continued
Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the man. “Come in,” and as he spoke
he looked somewhat embarrassed and anxious, for
this was doubtless the first time he had had any
dealings with a newspaper. Lying on a bed in an
alcove was a woman who looked very ill, and piled
in a corner near the door were a couple of boxes
and a few pieces of furniture. The stove had not
yet been taken down, and some pale embers in it
only just kept the chill off the atmosphere. Fred
took off his hat, and led the man across the room
toward the window.</p>

<p>“Have you been dispossessed?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man; “we must leave to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the reporter.</p>

<p>Cressy smiled in a ghastly sort of way.</p>

<p>“Because,” he replied—“because I have not a
cent to my name, sir, and the landlord has got it in
for me—and I must go.”</p>

<p>“Who is your landlord?” asked the reporter.</p>

<p>“Baggold—Q. C. Baggold, the shoe-man.”</p>

<p>“How much do you owe?”</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars—two months’ rent.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever in arrears before?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? Out of work?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I have been. But I’ve got a job now,
and I’ll have money on the tenth of the month.
But that is not it.”</p>

<p>“What is ‘it,’ then?” continued Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. I don’t want this in the
paper, but I’ll tell you. Baggold hates me. He
knows the woman’s sick, and he takes advantage
of my owing him to drive me out. Do you want
to know why? Well, I’ll tell you. I worked for
him for five years, sir, in his shoe-factory. He
brought me over from France to do the fine work.
He had a lawsuit about six months ago, and he
offered me $500 to lie for him on the stand. I
would not do it, sir, and when they called me as a
witness I told the truth, and that settled the case,
and Baggold had to pay $10,000, sir, for a sly game
on a contract. Then he sent me off, and I’ve been
looking for a job, and I’ve got behind, and I’m
just getting up again, and here he is sending me
out into the snow! To-morrow is what we call at
home, in France, the <i lang="fr">jour de l’an</i>—the day of the
New Year, sir, and it is a fête. And the little one,
here, always looked forward to that day, sir, for a
doll or a few sweetmeats; but this time—I don’t
think she’ll have a roof for her little head! I have
not a place in the world to go to, sir, but to the
police station, and there’s the woman on her
back!”</p>

<p>Two big tears rolled down the man’s cheeks.
Fred felt a lump rising in his throat, and he
knew that if he had had twenty dollars in his
pocket he would have given it to Cressy. But
he did not have twenty dollars, so he coughed
vigorously, and put on his hat quickly, and
said:</p>

<p>“Well, this is hard, Mr. Cressy. I’ll see what
we can do. I must go up town for a while, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
then I’ll come back and see you. Don’t move out
in this storm till the last minute.”</p>

<p>As he rushed down the stairs he met the little
girl coming back with a big blue bottle of something
with a yellow label on it. He stopped and
pulled a quarter out of his pocket, thrust it into
the child’s hand, and leaped on down the stairs,
leaving the little girl more frightened than surprised,
as he dashed out into the snow.</p>

<p>He entered the first drug-store he came to and
looked up Q. C. Baggold’s address in the directory.
It was nearly four o’clock, and he argued the rich
shoe-manufacturer would be at his home. The
address given in the directory was in a broad street
in the fashionable quarter of the city. Half an
hour later Fred was pulling at Mr. Baggold’s door-bell.
The butler who answered the summons
thought Mr. Baggold was in, and took Fred’s card
after showing the young man into the parlor. This
was a large elegantly furnished room filled with
costly ornaments, almost any one of which, if offered
for sale, would have brought the amount of
Cressy’s debt, or much more.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Baggold came into the room. He
was a short man with a bald head and a sharp nose,
and his small eyes were fixed very close to one another
under a not very high forehead.</p>

<p>“I am a reporter from the <cite>Gazette</cite>,” began Fred
at once. “I have called to see you, Mr. Baggold,
about this man Cressy whom you have ordered to
be dispossessed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said Mr. Baggold, smiling. “My
agent has told me something about this matter, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
I hardly think it is of sufficient importance to be of
interest to the readers of the <cite>Gazette</cite>.”</p>

<p>“The readers of the <cite>Gazette</cite>,” continued Fred
“are always interested in good deeds, Mr. Baggold,
and especially when these are performed by rich
men. I came here hoping you would disavow the
action of your agent, and say that the Cressy’s
might remain in the room.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” replied Mr. Baggold. “I cannot
interfere with my agent. I pay him to take care
of my rents, and I can’t be looking after fellows
who won’t pay. This man Cressy is in arrears, and
he must get out.”</p>

<p>“But his wife is sick,” argued Fred.</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted the other. “That is an old excuse.
These scoundrels try all sorts of dodges to
cheat a man whom they think has money.”</p>

<p>“This woman is actually sick, Mr. Baggold,”
said Fred, severely, “and to drive her out in a
storm like this is positive cruelty.”</p>

<p>“Cressy has had two weeks to find other quarters,
and to-morrow is the first of the month. I can’t
keep him any longer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow is the great French fête-day,
and you put Cressy in the street.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” returned the rich man, “I cannot
allow sentiment to interfere with my business. If
I did I should never collect rents in Houston Street.
And, as I told you before, I do not see that this
question is one to interest the public. It is purely
a matter of my private business.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” replied Fred; “but I don’t think it
would look well in print.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>This statement seemed to startle Mr. Baggold a
little, and Fred thought it made him feel uncomfortable.
There was a brief silence, after which
the rich man said:</p>

<p>“It would depend entirely upon how you put it
in print. To tell you the truth, I am not at all in
favor of these sensational articles that so many
newspapers publish nowadays. Reporters often
jump at conclusions before they are familiar with
the facts of a case, and it makes things disagreeable
for all concerned. Now, if you will only listen
to me, sir, I think we can come to an understanding
about this Cressy matter. I don’t want anything
about it to get into the papers—especially
now. I have many reasons, but I cannot give them
to you. Yet I think we can come to an understanding,”
he repeated, as he looked at Fred and
smiled.</p>

<p>“How?” asked the reporter.</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Mr. Baggold, “there are some
points that I may be able to explain to you. Of
course I don’t want to put you to any trouble for
nothing. If it is worth something to me not to
have notoriety thrust upon me, of course, on the
other hand, it might be worth something to you
to cause the notoriety. But just excuse me a
moment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baggold arose hastily and stepped into a
rear room, apparently his library or study.</p>

<p>“H’m,” thought Fred to himself. “This old
chap talks as though he were going to offer me
money. I’d just like to see him try! I’d give him
such a roasting as he has never had before! Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of these crooked old millionaires think that sort of
thing works with reporters, but I’ll show him that
it does not. I have never known a newspaper man
yet that would accept a bribe.”</p>

<p>And as Fred mused in this fashion, Mr. Baggold
returned. He bore a long yellow envelope in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, “are some papers and other
things that I should like to have you look over
before you write the article. I think they will influence
you in your opinion of the matter. I am
sorry I cannot tell you any more just now, but I
have an appointment which I must keep. Take
these papers and look them over at your leisure,
and if you find later this evening that they are not
satisfactory, I will talk with you further. Good-afternoon,
sir. I hope you will excuse me for the
present.”</p>

<p>And so saying he handed the envelope to Fred,
bowed pleasantly, and left the room. Fred had
been standing near the door, and so he put the
envelope in his pocket and went out. He walked
a few blocks down the street, and went into the
large hotel on the corner in order to get out of the
storm and to find some quiet place where he might
look over Mr. Baggold’s documents. He was very
curious to see what they could be. He found a
seat in a secluded corner of the office, and there
tore open the envelope. To his disgust, it contained
three ten-dollar bills, and a brief note, unsigned,
which read,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The accompanying papers will show you that the matter
we spoke of is not of sufficient importance to be published.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Fred Hallowell was furious. This was the first
time in his brief career as a newspaper man that
anything like this had happened to him. He grew
red in the face, his fingers twitched, and he felt as
if he had never before been so grossly insulted.
As he sat in his chair, fuming and wondering what
he should do, Griggs, the fat and jolly political
reporter of the <cite>Gazette</cite>, came up to him and said,
laughing,</p>

<p>“Well, you look as if you were plotting murder!”</p>

<p>“I am—almost!” exclaimed Fred, and then he
told Griggs all about what had happened.</p>

<p>Griggs listened patiently, and at the end he
chuckled to himself, and said: “Well, Hallowell,
don’t waste any righteous wrath on any such stuff
as that Baggold. I’ll tell you how to get even with
him.” And then he talked for twenty minutes to
the younger man.</p>

<p>At the end of the conference Fred smiled and
buttoned his coat, and hastened back to Cressy’s
room in Houston Street. He found a Sister of
Charity there nursing the sick woman. Cressy
came to the door, pale and eager.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said nervously.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” returned Fred, laughing. “I
have just seen Mr. Baggold. He said his agent
was perfectly right in having you dispossessed, because
that was business; but when he heard what I
had to say, he gave me this money.” And here
Fred handed out the thirty dollars. “It is for you
to pay the agent with, and then you can keep your
room, and you will have ten dollars besides.”</p>

<p>Cressy was speechless. The sick woman wept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
softly. The Sister said something in Latin, and
the little girl just looked; she did not understand
what it was all about.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Fred to Cressy, “I suppose Mr.
Baggold does not want his business to be interfered
with by his sentiment.” And before Cressy could
reply the reporter had slipped out of the door, and
in a moment was hurrying down town to his office.</p>

<p>The next morning—New-Year’s morning—the
<cite>Gazette</cite> contained a pretty little story of how a rich
man, who had heard of the distress of a tenant, put
his hand in his own pocket and paid his tenant’s
rent to himself, so that the new year would begin
well for him by having rents coming in at the very
opening of the twelvemonth.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Baggold was surprised this morning
when he read that,” gurgled the genial Griggs;
“but it will do him more good than ten columns of
abuse and exposure. So here’s a Happy New
Year to him!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The play over, O’Leary charged himself with
the protection of madam, while I enveloped
Emily in her cashmere, and drew her arm within
my own. What my hand had to do with hers I
know not; it remains one of the unexplained difficulties
of that eventful evening. I have, it is true,
a hazy recollection of pressing some very taper
and delicately formed fingers; and remember, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the pain I felt next morning on awaking, by the
pressure of a too tight ring, which had, by some
strange accident, found its way to my finger, for
which its size was but ill adapted.</p>

<p>“You will join us at supper, I hope,” said Mrs.
Bingham, as Trevanion handed her to her carriage.
“Mr. Lorrequer, Mr. O’Leary, we shall expect
you.”</p>

<p>I was about to promise to do so, when Trevanion
suddenly interrupted me, saying that he had already
accepted an invitation, which would, unfortunately,
prevent us; and having hastily wished
the ladies good-night, hurried me away so abruptly,
that I had not a moment given for even one parting
look at the fair Emily.</p>

<p>“Why, Trevanion,” said I, “what invitation are
you dreaming of? I, for one, should have been
delighted to have gone home with the Binghams.”</p>

<p>“So I perceive,” said Trevanion, gravely; “and
it was for that precise reason I so firmly refused
what, individually, I should have been most happy
to accept.”</p>

<p>“Then pray have the goodness to explain.”</p>

<p>“It is easily done. You have already, in recounting
your manifold embarrassments, told me
enough of these people, to let me see that they intend
you should marry among them; and, indeed,
you have gone quite far enough to encourage such
an expectation. Your present excited state has
led you sufficiently far this evening, and I could
not answer for your not proposing in all form before
the supper was over; therefore, I had no other
course open to me than positively to refuse Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Bingham’s invitation. But here we are now at the
‘Cadran rouge;’ we shall have our lobster and a
glass of Moselle, and then to bed, for we must not
forget that we are to be at St. Cloud by seven.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is a good thought of yours about the
lobsters,” said O’Leary; “and now, as you understand
these matters, just order supper, and let us
enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>With all the accustomed dispatch of a <i lang="fr">restaurant</i>,
a most appetizing <i lang="fr">petit souper</i> made its speedy
appearance; and although now perfectly divested
of the high excitement which had hitherto possessed
me, my spirits were excellent, and I never more
relished our good fare and good fellowship.</p>

<p>After a toast to the health of the fair Emily had
been proposed and drained by all three, Trevanion
again explained how much more serious difficulty
would result from any false step in that quarter
than from all my other scrapes collectively.</p>

<p>This he represented so strongly, that for the first
time I began to perceive the train of ill consequences
that must inevitably result, and promised
most faithfully to be guided by any counsel he
might feel disposed to give me.</p>

<p>“Ah! what a pity,” said O’Leary, “it is not my
case. It’s very little trouble it would cost any one
to break off a match for me. I had always a most
peculiar talent for those things.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Trevanion. “Pray, may we
know your secret? for perhaps, ere long, we may
have occasion for its employment.”</p>

<p>“Tell it, by all means,” said I.</p>

<p>“If I do,” said O’Leary, “it will cost you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
patient hearing; for my experiences are connected
with an episode in my early life, which, although
not very amusing, is certainly instructive.”</p>

<p>“Oh! by all means, let us hear it,” said Trevanion.</p>

<p>“Well, agreed,” said O’Leary; “only once for
all, as what I am about to confide is strictly confidential,
you must promise never even to allude to
it hereafter in even the most remote manner, much
less indulge in any unseemly mirth at what I shall
relate.”</p>

<p>Having pledged ourselves to secrecy and a becoming
seriousness, O’Leary began his story as
follows:</p>

<p>“You may easily suppose,” began Mr. O’Leary,
“that the unhappy termination of my first passion
served as a shield to me for a long time against my
unfortunate tendencies toward the fair, and such
was really the case. I never spoke to a young lady
for three years after, without a reeling in my head,
so associated in my mind was love and sea-sickness.
However, at last, what will not time do? It was
about four years from the date of this adventure,
when I became so oblivious of my former failure,
as again to tempt my fortune. My present choice,
in every way unlike the last, was a gay, lively girl,
of great animal spirits, and a considerable turn for
raillery, that spared no one; the members of her
own family were not even sacred in her eyes; and
her father, a reverend dean, as frequently figured
among the ludicrous as his neighbors.</p>

<p>“The Evershams had been very old friends of a
rich aunt of mine, who never, by the by, had condescended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to notice me till I made their acquaintance;
but no sooner had I done so, than she sent for
me, and gave me to understand that in the event of
my succeeding to the hand of Fanny Eversham,
I should be her heir and the possessor of about sixty
thousand pounds. She did not stop here; but by
canvassing the dean in my favor, speedily put the
matter on a most favorable footing, and in less than
two months I was received as the accepted suitor of
the fair Fanny, then one of the reigning belles of
Dublin.</p>

<p>“They lived at this time, about three miles from
town, in a very pretty country, where I used to
pass all my mornings, and many of my evenings,
too, in a state of happiness that I should have considered
perfect, if it were not for two unhappy
blots—one, the taste of my betrothed for laughing
at her friends; another, the diabolical propensity of
my intended father-in-law to talk politics; to the
former I could submit; but with the latter submission
only made bad worse; for he invariably drew
up as I receded, dryly observing that with men who
had no avowed opinions, it was ill-agreeing; or that,
with persons who kept their politics as a school-boy
does his pocket-money, never to spend, and always
ready to change, it was unpleasant to dispute.
Such taunts as these I submitted to, as well I
might; secretly resolving, that as I now knew the
meaning of Whig and Tory, I’d contrive to spend
my life, after marriage, out of the worthy dean’s
diocese.</p>

<p>“Time wore on, and at length, to my most pressing
solicitations it was conceded that a day for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
marriage should be appointed. Not even the unlucky
termination of this my second love affair
can deprive me of the happy souvenir of the few
weeks which were to intervene before our destined
union.</p>

<p>“The mornings were passed in ransacking all the
shops where wedding finery could be procured—laces,
blondes, velvets, and satins, littered every
corner of the deanery—and there was scarcely a
carriage in a coach-maker’s yard in the city that I
had not sat and jumped in, to try the springs, by
the special direction of Mrs. Eversham, who never
ceased to impress me with the awful responsibility
I was about to take upon me, in marrying so great
a prize as her daughter—a feeling I found very
general among many of my friends at the Kildare
Street club.</p>

<p>“Among the many indispensable purchases which
I was to make, and about which Fanny expressed
herself more than commonly anxious, was a saddle-horse
for me. She was a great horse-woman, and
hated riding with only a servant; and had given me
to understand as much about half-a-dozen times
each day for the last five weeks. How shall I
acknowledge it—equestrianism was never my forte.
I had all my life considerable respect for the horse
as an animal, pretty much as I dreaded a lion or a
tiger; but as to any intention of mounting upon
the back of one, and taking a ride, I should as soon
have dreamed of taking an airing upon a giraffe;
and as to the thought of buying, feeding, and maintaining
such a beast at my own proper cost, I
should just as soon have determined to purchase a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
pillory or a ducking-stool, by way of amusing my
leisure hours.</p>

<p>“However, Fanny was obstinate—whether she
suspected anything or not I cannot say—but nothing
seemed to turn her from her purpose; and although
I pleaded a thousand things in delay, yet
she grew each day more impatient, and at last I
saw there was nothing for it but to submit.</p>

<p>“When I arrived at this last bold resolve, I could
not help feeling that to possess a horse, and not be
able to mount him, was only deferring the ridicule;
and as I had so often expressed the difficulty I felt
in suiting myself as a cause of my delay, I could not
possibly come forward with anything very objectionable,
or I should be only the more laughed at.
There was, then, but one course to take; a fortnight
still intervened before the day which was to make
me happy, and I accordingly resolved to take lessons
in riding during the interval, and by every
endeavor in my power become, if possible, able to
pass muster on the saddle before my bride.</p>

<p>“Poor old Lalouette understood but little of the
urgency of the case, when I requested his leave to
take my lessons each morning at six o’clock, for I
dared not absent myself during the day without exciting
suspicion; and never, I will venture to assert,
did knight-errant of old strive harder for the hand
of his lady-love than did I during that weary fortnight;
if a hippogriff had been the animal I bestrode,
instead of being, as it was, an old wall-eyed
gray, I could not have felt more misgivings at my
temerity, or more proud of my achievement. In
the first three days the unaccustomed exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
proved so severe, that when I reached the deanery I
could hardly move, and crossed the floor pretty
much as a pair of compasses might be supposed to
do if performing that exploit. Nothing, however,
could equal the kindness of my poor dear mother-in-law
in embryo, and even the dean too. Fanny indeed,
said nothing; but I rather think she was disposed
to giggle a little; but my rheumatism, as it
was called, was daily inquired after, and I was compelled
to take some infernal stuff in my port wine,
at dinner, that nearly made me sick at table.</p>

<p>“‘I am sure you walk too much,’ said Fanny,
with one of her knowing looks. ‘Papa, don’t you
think he ought to ride? it would be much better
for him.’</p>

<p>“‘I do, my dear,’ said the dean. ‘But then you
see he is so hard to be pleased in a horse. Your old
hunting days have spoiled you; but you must forget
Melton and Grantham, and condescend to keep
a hack.’</p>

<p>“I must have looked confoundedly foolish here,
for Fanny never took her eyes off me, and continued
to laugh in her own wicked way.</p>

<p>“It was now about the ninth or tenth day of my
purgatorial performances; and certainly, if there
be any merit in fleshly mortifications, these religious
exercises of mine should stand my part hereafter.
A review had been announced in the Phœnix park,
which Fanny had expressed herself most desirous
to witness; and as the dean would not permit her
to go without a chaperon, I had no means of
escape, and promised to escort her. No sooner had
I made this rash pledge than I hastened to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
confidential friend, Lalouette, and having imparted
to him my entire secret, asked him in a solemn and
imposing manner, ‘Can I do it?’ The old man
shook his head dubiously, looked grave, and muttered
at length, ‘Mosch depend on de horse.’ ‘I
know it—I know it—I feel it,’ said I, eagerly—‘then
where are we to find an animal that will carry
me peaceably through this awful day? I care not
for his price.’</p>

<p>“‘Votre affaire ne sera pas trop chère,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Why, how do you mean?’ said I.</p>

<p>“He then proceeded to inform me that, by a
singularly fortunate chance, there took place that
day an auction of ‘cast horses,’ as they are termed,
which had been used in the horse police force; and
that from long riding and training to stand fire,
nothing could be more suitable than one of these,
being both easy to ride and not given to start at
noise.</p>

<p>“I could have almost hugged the old fellow for
his happy suggestion, and waited with impatience
for three o’clock to come, when we repaired together
to Essexbridge, at that time the place selected
for these sales.</p>

<p>“I was at first a little shocked at the look of the
animals drawn up; they were most miserably thin,
most of them swelled in the legs, few without sore
backs, and not one eye on an average in every
three; but still they were all high-steppers, and
carried a great tail. ‘There’s your affaire,’ said the
old Frenchman, as a long-legged, fiddle-headed
beast was led out; turning out his forelegs so as to
endanger the man who walked beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Yes, there’s blood for you,’ said Charley
Dycer, seeing my eye fixed on the wretched beast;
‘equal to fifteen stone with any fox-hounds; safe
in all his paces, and warranted sound; except,’
added he, in a whisper, ‘a slight spavin in both hind
legs, ring-bone, and a little touch in the wind.’
Here the animal gave an approving cough. ‘Will
any gentleman say fifty pounds to begin?’ But no
gentleman did. A hackney-coachman, however,
said five, and the sale was opened; the beast trotting
up and down nearly over the bidders at every
moment, and plunging on so that it was impossible
to know what was doing.</p>

<p>“‘Five ten—fifteen—six pounds—thank you, sir—guineas—seven
pounds,’ said I, bidding against
myself, not perceiving that I had spoken last.
‘Thank you, Mr. Moriarty,’ said Dycer, turning
toward an invisible purchaser supposed to be in the
crowd. ‘Thank you, sir, you’ll not let a good one
go that way.’ Every one here turned to find out
the very knowing gentleman; but he could nowhere
be seen.</p>

<p>“Dycer resumed, ‘Seven ten, for Mr. Moriarty.
Going for seven ten—a cruel sacrifice—there’s action
for you—playful beast.’ Here the devil had
stumbled and nearly killed a basket-woman with
two children.</p>

<p>“‘Eight,’ said I, with a loud voice.</p>

<p>“‘Eight pounds, quite absurd,’ said Dycer, almost
rudely; ‘a charger like that for eight pounds—going
for eight pounds—going—nothing above
eight pounds—no reserve, gentlemen, you are
aware of that. They are all, as it were, his Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
stud—no reserve whatever—last time, eight
pounds—gone.’</p>

<p>“Amid a very hearty cheer from the mob, God
knows why, but a Dublin mob always cheers—I returned
accompanied by a ragged fellow, leading
my new purchase after me with a hay halter.</p>

<p>“‘What is the meaning of those letters?’ said I,
pointing to a very conspicuous G. R., with sundry
other enigmatical signs, burned upon the animal’s
hind quarter.</p>

<p>“‘That’s to show he was a po-lis,’ said the fellow
with a grin; ‘and when ye ride with ladies, ye must
turn the decoy side.”</p>

<p>“The auspicious morning at last arrived; and,
strange to say, that the first waking thought was of
the unlucky day that ushered in my yachting excursion,
four years before. Why this was so I cannot
pretend to guess: there was but little analogy
in the circumstances, at least so far as anything had
then gone. ‘How is Marius?’ said I to my servant,
as he opened my shutters. Here let me mention
that a friend of the Kildare Street club had suggested
this name from the remarkably classic character
of my steed’s countenance; his nose, he
assured me, was perfectly Roman.</p>

<p>“‘Marius is doing finely, sir, barring his cough,
and the trifle that ails his hind legs.’</p>

<p>“‘He’ll carry me quietly, Simon; eh?’</p>

<p>“‘Quietly! I’ll warrant he’ll carry you quietly,
if that’s all.’</p>

<p>“Here was comfort, certainly. Simon had lived
forty years as pantry boy with my mother, and
knew a great deal about horses. I dressed myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
therefore, in high spirits; and if my pilot jacket
and oil-skin cap in former days had half persuaded
me that I was born for marine achievements, certainly
my cords and tops, that morning, went far
to convince me that I must have once been a very
keen sportsman somewhere, without knowing it.
It was a delightful July day that I set out to join
my friends, who, having recruited a large party,
were to rendezvous at the corner of Stephen’s
Green; thither I proceeded in a certain rambling
trot, which I have often observed is a very favorite
pace with timid horsemen and gentlemen of the
medical profession. I was hailed with a most
hearty welcome by a large party as I turned out of
Grafton Street, among whom I perceived several
friends of Miss Eversham, and some young dragoon
officers, not of my acquaintance, but who appeared
to know Fanny intimately, and were
laughing heartily with her as I rode up.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if other men have experienced
what I am about to mention or not; but certainly
to me there is no more painful sensation than to
find yourself among a number of well-mounted,
well-equipped people, while the animal you yourself
bestride seems only fit for the kennel. Every
look that is cast at your unlucky steed—every
whispered observation about you are so many
thorns in your flesh, till at last you begin to feel
that your appearance is for very little else than
the amusement and mirth of the assembly; and
every time you rise in your stirrups you excite a
laugh.</p>

<p>“‘Where, for mercy’s sake, did you find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
creature?’ said Fanny, surveying Marius through
her glass.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, him, eh? Why, he is a handsome horse, if
in condition—a charger, you know—that’s his
style.’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed,’ lisped a young lancer, ‘I should be
devilish sorry to charge, or be charged with him.’
And here they all chuckled at this puppy’s silly
joke, and I drew up to repress further liberties.</p>

<p>“‘Is he anything of a fencer?’ said a young country
gentleman.</p>

<p>“‘To judge from his near eye, I should say much
more of a boxer,’ said another.</p>

<p>“Here commenced a running fire of pleasantry
at the expense of my poor steed; which, not content
with attacking his physical, extended to his moral
qualities. An old gentleman near me observing,
‘that I ought not to have mounted him at all, seeing
he was so deuced groggy;’ to which I replied,
by insinuating, that if others present were as free
from the influence of ardent spirits, society would
not be a sufferer; an observation that, I flatter myself,
turned the mirth against the old fellow, for
they all laughed for a quarter of an hour after.</p>

<p>“Well, at last we set out in a brisk trot, and,
placed near Fanny, I speedily forgot all my annoyances
in the prospect of figuring to advantage before
her. When we reached the College Green the
leaders of the cortège suddenly drew up, and we
soon found that the entire street opposite the Bank
was filled with a dense mob of people, who appeared
to be swayed hither and thither, like some
mighty beast, as the individuals composing it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
engaged in close conflict. It was nothing more nor
less than one of those almost weekly rows which
then took place between the students of the University
and the town’s-people, and which rarely
ended without serious consequences. The numbers
of people pressing on to the scene of action soon
blocked up our retreat, and we found ourselves
most unwilling spectators of the conflict. Political
watch-words were loudly shouted by each party;
and at last the students, who appeared to be yielding
to superior numbers, called out for the intervention
of the police. The aid was nearer than they
expected; for at the same instant a body of
mounted policemen, whose high helmets rendered
them sufficiently conspicuous, were seen trotting at
sharp pace down Dame Street. On they came with
drawn sabres, led by a well-looking, gentleman-like
personage in plain clothes, who dashed at once into
the middle of the fray, issuing his orders, and
pointing out to his followers to secure the ring-leaders.
Up to this moment I had been a most
patient and rather amused spectator of what was
doing. Now, however, my part was to commence,
for at the word ‘Charge,’ given in a harsh, deep
voice by the sergeant of the party, Marius, remembering
his ancient instinct, pricked up his ears,
cocked his tail, flung up both his hind legs till they
nearly broke the Provost’s windows, and plunged
into the thickest of the fray like a devil incarnate.</p>

<p>“Self-preservation must be a strong instinct, for
I well remember how little pain it cost me to see the
people tumbling and rolling beneath me, while I
continued to keep my seat. It was only a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
before, and that immense mass were a man-to-man
encounter, now all the indignation of both parties
seemed turned upon me; brick-bats were loudly
implored and paving-stones begged to throw at my
devoted head; the Wild Huntsman of the German
romance never created half the terror nor one-tenth
of the mischief that I did in less than fifteen
minutes, for the ill-starred beast continued twining
and twisting like a serpent, plunging and kicking
the entire time, and occasionally biting too; all
which accomplishments, I afterwards learned,
however little in request in civil life, are highly
prized in the horse police.</p>

<p>“Every new order of the sergeant was followed
in his own fashion by Marius, who very soon contrived
to concentrate in my unhappy person all the
interest of about fifteen hundred people.</p>

<p>“‘Secure that scoundrel,’ said the magistrate,
pointing with his finger towards me, as I rode over
a respectable-looking old lady with a gray muff.
‘Secure him. Cut him down.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, devil’s luck to him, if ye do,’ said a newsmonger
with a broken shin.</p>

<p>“On I went, however; and now, as the Fates
would have it, instead of bearing me out of further
danger, the confounded brute dashed onward to
where the magistrate was standing, surrounded by
policemen. I thought I saw him change color as I
came on. I suppose my own looks were none of
the pleasantest, for the worthy man evidently liked
them not. Into the midst of them we plunged, upsetting
a corporal, horse and all, and appearing as
if bent upon reaching the alderman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Cut him down, for Heaven’s sake. Will nobody
shoot him?’ said he, with a voice trembling
with fear and anger.</p>

<p>“At these words a wretch lifted up his sabre, and
made a cut at my head. I stooped suddenly, and
throwing myself from the saddle, seized the poor
alderman round the neck, and both came rolling to
the ground together. So completely was he possessed
with the notion that I meant to assassinate
him, that while I was endeavoring to extricate myself
from his grasp, he continued to beg his life in
the most heart-rending manner.</p>

<p>“My story is now soon told. So effectually did
they rescue the alderman from his danger that they
left me insensible, and I only came to myself some
days after by finding myself in the dock in Green
Street, charged with an indictment of nineteen
counts; the only word of truth is what lay in the
preamble, for the ‘devil inciting’ me only would
ever have made me the owner of that infernal
beast, the cause of all my misfortunes. I was so
stupefied from my beating that I know little of
the course of the proceedings. My friends told me
afterward that I had a narrow escape from transportation;
but for the greatest influence exerted in
my behalf, I should certainly have passed the
autumn in the agreeable recreation of pounding
oyster-shells or carding wool; and it certainly must
have gone hard with me, for, stupefied as I was, I
remember the sensation in court when the alderman
made his appearance with a patch over his eye.
The affecting admonition of the little judge—who,
when passing sentence upon me, adverted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
former respectability of my life and the rank of my
relatives—actually made the galleries weep.</p>

<p>“Four months in Newgate and a fine to the king,
then, rewarded my taste for horse exercise; and it’s
no wonder if I prefer going on foot.</p>

<p>“As to Miss Eversham, the following short note
from the dean concluded my hopes in that quarter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘Deanery, Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>“‘Sir—After the very distressing publicity to
which your late conduct has exposed you—the so
open avowal of political opinions, at variance with
those (I will say) of every gentleman—and the recorded
sentence of a judge on the verdict of twelve
of your countrymen—I should hope that you will
not feel my present admonition necessary to inform
you that your visits to my house shall cease.</p>

<p>“‘The presents you made my daughter, when
under our unfortunate ignorance of your real character,
have been addressed to your hotel, and I am
your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">“‘Oliver Eversham.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Here ended my second affair ‘par amour;’ and
I freely confess to you that if I can only obtain a
wife in a sea voyage, or a steeple-chase, I am likely
to fulfil one great condition in modern advertising—‘as
having no incumbrance, nor any objection to
travel.’”</p>

<p>It happened that the undersigned spent the last
Christmas season in a foreign city where there were
many English children.</p>

<p>In that city, if you wanted to give a child’s party,
you could not even get a magic-lantern or buy
Twelfth-Night characters—those funny painted
pictures of the King, the Queen, the Lover, the
Lady, the Dandy, the Captain, and so on—with
which our young ones are wont to recreate themselves
at this festive time.</p>

<p>My friend Miss Bunch, who was governess of a
large family that lived in the <i lang="it">Piano Nobile</i> of the
house inhabited by myself and my young charges
(it was the Palazzo Poniatowski at Rome, and
Messrs. Spillmann, two of the best pastrycooks in
Christendom, have their shop on the ground floor):
Miss Bunch, I say, begged me to draw a set of
Twelfth-Night characters for the amusement of our
young people.</p>

<p>She is a lady of great fancy and droll imagination,
and having looked at the characters, she and
I composed a history about them, which was
recited to the little folks at night, and served as our
fireside pantomime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>Our juvenile audience was amused by the adventures
of Giglio and Bulbo, Rosalba and Angelica.
I am bound to say the fate of the Hall Porter
created a considerable sensation; and the wrath of
Countess Gruffanuff was received with extreme
pleasure.</p>

<p>If these children are pleased, thought I, why
should not others be amused also? In a few days
Dr. Birch’s young friends will be expected to re-assemble
at Rodwell Regis, where they will learn
everything that is useful, and under the eyes of
careful ushers continue the business of their little
lives.</p>

<p>But, in the meanwhile, and for a brief holiday,
let us laugh and be as pleasant as we can. And you
elder folk—a little joking, and dancing, and fooling
will do even you no harm. The author wishes you
a merry Christmas, and welcomes you to the Fireside
Pantomime.</p>

<span class="smaller">SHOWS HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY SATE DOWN TO
BREAKFAST</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">This is Valoroso XXIV., King of Paflagonia,
seated with his Queen and only child at their
royal breakfast-table, and receiving the letter which
announces to His Majesty a proposed visit from
Prince Bulbo, heir of Padella, reigning King of
Crim Tartary. Remark the delight upon the monarch’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
royal features. He is so absorbed in the
perusal of the King of Crim Tartary’s letter that
he allows his eggs to get cold, and leaves his august
muffins untasted.</p>

<p>“What! that wicked, brave, delightful Prince
Bulbo!” cries Princess Angelica; “so handsome, so
accomplished, so witty—the conqueror of Rimbombamento,
where he slew ten thousand giants!”</p>

<p>“Who told you of him, my dear?” asks His
Majesty.</p>

<p>“A little bird,” says Angelica.</p>

<p>“Poor Giglio!” says mamma, pouring out the tea.</p>

<p>“Bother Giglio!” cries Angelica, tossing up her
head, which rustled with a thousand curl-papers.</p>

<p>“I wish,” growls the King—“I wish Giglio
was.…”</p>

<p>“Was better? Yes, dear, he is better,” says the
Queen. “Angelica’s little maid, Betsinda, told me
so when she came to my room this morning with my
early tea.”</p>

<p>“You are always drinking tea,” said the monarch,
with a scowl.</p>

<p>“It is better than drinking port or brandy and
water,” replies Her Majesty.</p>

<p>“Well, well, my dear, I only said you were fond
of drinking tea,” said the King of Paflagonia, with
an effort as if to command his temper. “Angelica!
I hope you have plenty of new dresses; your milliner’s
bills are long enough. My dear Queen, you
must see and have some parties. I prefer dinners,
but of course you will be for balls. Your everlasting
blue velvet quite tires me: and, my love, I should
like you to have a new necklace. Order one. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p>“And Giglio, dear?” says the Queen.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Giglio may go to the</span>—”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” screams Her Majesty. “Your own
nephew! our late King’s only son.”</p>

<p>“Giglio may go to the tailor’s, and order the bills
to be sent in to Glumboso to pay. Confound him!
I mean bless his dear heart. He need want for
nothing; give him a couple of guineas for pocket-money,
my dear; and you may as well order yourself
bracelets while you are about the necklace,
Mrs. V.”</p>

<p>Her Majesty, or <em>Mrs. V.</em>, as the monarch facetiously
called her (for even royalty will have its
sport, and this august family were very much attached),
embraced her husband, and, twining her
arm round her daughter’s waist, they quitted the
breakfast-room in order to make all things ready
for the princely stranger.</p>

<p>When they were gone, the smile that had lighted
up the eyes of the <em>husband</em> and <em>father</em> fled—the
pride of the <em>King</em> fled—the <span class="smcapuc">MAN</span> was alone. Had
I the pen of a G. P. R. James, I would describe
Valoroso’s torments in the choicest language; in
which I would also depict his flashing eye, his distended
nostril—his dressing-gown, pocket-handkerchief,
and boots. But I need not say I have <em>not</em> the
pen of that novelist; suffice it to say, Valoroso was
alone.</p>

<p>He rushed to the cupboard, seizing from the
table one of the many egg-cups with which his
princely board was served for the matin meal, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
out a bottle of right Nantz or Cognac, filled and
emptied the cup several times, and laid it down with
a hoarse “Ha, ha, ha! now Valoroso is a man
again!”</p>

<p>“But oh!” he went on (still sipping, I am sorry
to say), “ere I was a king, I needed not this intoxicating
draught; once I detested the hot brandy
wine, and quaffed no other fount but nature’s rill.
It dashes not more quickly o’er the rocks than I
did, as, with blunderbuss in hand, I brushed away
the early morning dew, and shot the partridge,
snipe, or antlered deer! Ah! well may England’s
dramatist remark, ‘Uneasy lies the head that wears
a crown!’ Why did I steal my nephew’s, my young
Giglio’s—? Steal! said I? no, no, no, not steal, not
steal. Let me withdraw that odious expression. I
took, and on my manly head I set, the royal crown
of Paflagonia; I took, and with my royal arm I
wield, the sceptral rod of Paflagonia; I took, and
in my outstretched hand I hold, the royal orb of
Paflagonia! Could a poor boy, a snivelling, drivelling
boy—was in his nurse’s arms but yesterday, and
cried for sugar-plums and puled for pap—bear up
the awful weight of crown, orb, scepter? gird on the
sword my royal fathers wore, and meet in fight the
tough Crimean foe?”</p>

<p>And then the monarch went on to argue in his
own mind (though we need not say that blank verse
is not argument) that what he had got it was his
duty to keep, and that, if at one time he had entertained
ideas of a certain restitution, which shall
be nameless, the prospect by a <em>certain marriage</em> of
uniting two crowns and two nations which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
engaged in bloody and expensive wars, as the Paflagonians
and the Crimeans had been, put the idea
of Giglio’s restoration to the throne out of the question:
nay, were his own brother, King Savio, alive,
he would certainly will away the crown from his
own son in order to bring about such a desirable
union.</p>

<p>Thus easily do we deceive ourselves! Thus do
we fancy what we wish is right! The King took
courage, read the papers, finished his muffins and
eggs, and rang the bell for his Prime Minister.
The Queen, after thinking whether she should go
up and see Giglio, who had been sick, thought,
“Not now. Business first; pleasure afterwards. I
will go and see dear Giglio this afternoon; and now
I will drive to the jeweller’s, to look for the necklace
and bracelets.” The Princess went up into her
own room, and made Betsinda, her maid, bring out
all her dresses; and as for Giglio, they forgot him
as much as I forget what I had for dinner last
Tuesday twelvemonth.</p>

<h3 id="ch2">II<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW KING VALOROSO GOT THE CROWN, AND PRINCE
GIGLIO WENT WITHOUT</span></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray2.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="The King on his throne" />
</div>

<p>Paflagonia, ten or twenty thousand years ago,
appears to have been one of those kingdoms where
the laws of succession were not settled; for when
King Savio died, leaving his brother Regent of the
kingdom, and guardian of Savio’s orphan infant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
this unfaithful regent took no sort of regard of
the late monarch’s will; had himself proclaimed
sovereign of Paflagonia under the title of King
Valoroso XXIV., had a most splendid coronation,
and ordered all the nobles of the kingdom to pay
him homage. So long as
Valoroso gave them
plenty of balls at Court,
plenty of money and lucrative
places, the Paflagonian
nobility did not
care who was king; and as
for the people, in those
early times, they were
equally indifferent. The
Prince Giglio, by reason
of his tender age at his
royal father’s death, did
not feel the loss of his
crown and empire. As
long as he had plenty of
toys and sweetmeats, a
holiday five times a week,
and a horse and gun to go
out shooting when he grew a little older, and, above
all, the company of his darling cousin, the King’s
only child, poor Giglio was perfectly contented;
nor did he envy his uncle the royal robes and
scepter, the great hot uncomfortable throne of
state, and the enormous cumbersome crown in
which that monarch appeared from morning till
night. King Valoroso’s portrait has been left to
us; and I think you will agree with me that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
have been sometimes <em>rather tired</em> of his velvet, and
his diamonds, and his ermine, and his grandeur. I
shouldn’t like to sit in that stifling robe with such
a thing as that on my head.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray3.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="The Queen on her throne" />
</div>

<p>No doubt, the Queen must have been lovely in
her youth, for though she grew rather stout in after
life, yet her features, as shown in her portrait, are
certainly <em>pleasing</em>. If
she was fond of flattery,
scandal, cards, and fine
clothes, let us deal
gently with her infirmities,
which, after all,
may be no greater than
our own. She was
kind to her nephew;
and if she had any
scruples of conscience
about her husband’s
taking the young
Prince’s crown, consoled
herself by thinking
that the King,
though a usurper, was
a most respectable
man, and that at his
death Prince Giglio
would be restored to his throne, and share it with
his cousin, whom he loved so fondly.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was Glumboso, an old
statesman, who most cheerfully swore fidelity to
King Valoroso, and in whose hands the monarch left
all the affairs of his kingdom. All Valoroso wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
was plenty of money, plenty of hunting, plenty of
flattery, and as little trouble as possible. As long
as he had his sport, this monarch cared little how
his people paid for it: he engaged in some wars, and
of course the Paflagonian newspapers announced
that he gained prodigious victories: he had statues
erected to himself in every city of the empire; and
of course his pictures placed everywhere, and in all
the print-shops: he was Valoroso the Magnanimous,
Valoroso the Victorious, Valoroso the Great, and so
forth—for even in these early times courtiers and
people knew how to flatter.</p>

<p>This royal pair had one only child, the Princess
Angelica, who, you may be sure, was a paragon in
the courtiers’ eyes, in her parents’, and in her own.
It was said she had the longest hair, the largest eyes,
the slimmest waist, the smallest foot, and the most
lovely complexion of any young lady in the Paflagonian
dominions. Her accomplishments were
announced to be even superior to her beauty; and
governesses used to shame their idle pupils by telling
them what Princess Angelica could do. She
could play the most difficult pieces of music at sight.
She could answer any one of “Mangnall’s Questions.”
She knew every date in the history of
Paflagonia, and every other country. She knew
French, English, Italian, German, Spanish, Hebrew,
Greek, Latin, Cappadocian, Samothracian,
Ægean and Crim Tartar. In a word, she was a
most accomplished young creature; and her governess
and lady-in-waiting was the severe Countess
Gruffanuff.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray4.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="The Countess Gruffanuff" />
</div>

<p>Would you not fancy, from this picture, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Gruffanuff must have been a person of the highest
birth? She looks so haughty that I should have
thought her a Princess at the very least, with a
pedigree reaching as far back as the Deluge. But
this lady was no better born than many other ladies
who give themselves airs;
and all sensible people
laughed at her absurd pretensions.
The fact is, she
had been maid-servant to
the Queen when Her
Majesty was only Princess
and her husband had been
head footman; but after his
death or <em>disappearance</em>, of
which you shall hear presently,
this Mrs. Gruffanuff,
by flattering, toadying, and
wheedling her royal mistress,
became a favorite
with the Queen (who was
rather a weak woman),
and Her Majesty gave her a title, and made her
nursery governess to the Princess.</p>

<p>And now I must tell you about the Princess’s
learning and accomplishments, for which she had
such a wonderful character. Clever Angelica
certainly was, but as <em>idle as possible</em>. Play at sight,
indeed! she could play one or two pieces, and pretend
that she had never seen them before; she could
answer half a dozen “Mangnall’s Questions”; but
then you must take care to ask the <em>right</em> ones. As
for her languages, she had masters in plenty, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
I doubt whether she knew more than a few phrases
in each, for all her pretence; and as for her embroidery
and her drawing, she showed beautiful
specimens, it is true, but <em>who did them</em>?</p>

<p>This obliges me to tell the truth, and to do so I
must go back ever so far, and tell you about the
Fairy Blackstick.</p>

<h3 id="ch3">III<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLS WHO THE FAIRY BLACKSTICK WAS, AND WHO
WERE EVER SO MANY GRAND PERSONAGES BESIDES</span></h3>

<p>Between the kingdoms of Paflagonia and Crim
Tartary, there lived a mysterious personage, who
was known in those countries as the Fairy Blackstick,
from the ebony wand or crutch which she carried;
on which she rode to the moon sometimes, or
upon other excursions of business or pleasure, and
with which she performed her wonders.</p>

<p>When she was young, and had been first taught
the art of conjuring by the necromancer, her
father, she was always practising her skill, whizzing
about from one kingdom to another upon her black
stick, and conferring her fairy favors upon this
Prince or that. She had scores of royal godchildren;
turned numberless wicked people into beasts,
birds, millstones, clocks, pumps, bootjacks, umbrellas,
or other absurd shapes; and, in a word, was
one of the most active and officious of the whole
College of fairies.</p>

<p>But after two or three thousand years of this
sport, I suppose Blackstick grew tired of it. Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
perhaps she thought, “What good am I doing by
sending this Princess to sleep for a hundred years?
by fixing a black pudding on to that booby’s nose?
by causing diamonds and pearls to drop from one
little girl’s mouth, and vipers and toads from another’s?
I begin to think I do as much harm as
good by my performances. I might as well shut
my incantations up, and allow things to take their
natural course.</p>

<p>“There were my two young goddaughters, King
Savio’s wife, and Duke Padella’s wife, I gave them
each a present, which was to render them charming
in the eyes of their husbands, and secure the affection
of those gentlemen as long as they lived.
What good did my Rose and my Ring do these two
women? None on earth. From having all their
whims indulged by their husbands, they became
capricious, lazy, ill-humored, absurdly vain, and
leered and languished, and fancied themselves irresistibly
beautiful, when they were really quite old
and hideous, the ridiculous creatures! They used
actually to patronise me when I went to pay them
a visit—<em>me</em>, the Fairy Blackstick, who knows all
the wisdom of the necromancers, and who could
have turned them into baboons, and all their diamonds
into strings of onions, by a single wave of
my rod!” So she locked up her books in her cupboard,
declined further magical performances, and
scarcely used her wand at all except as a cane to
walk about with.</p>

<p>So when Duke Padella’s lady had a little son
(the Duke was at that time only one of the principal
noblemen in Crim Tartary), Blackstick, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
invited to the christening, would not so
much as attend; but merely sent her compliments
and a silver papboat for the baby, which was really
not worth a couple of guineas. About the same
time the Queen of Paflagonia presented His Majesty
with a son and heir; and guns were fired, the
capital illuminated, and no end of feasts ordained
to celebrate the young Prince’s birth. It was
thought the Fairy, who was asked to be his godmother,
would at least have presented him with
an invisible jacket, a flying horse, a Fortunatus’s
purse, or some other valuable token of her favor;
but instead, Blackstick went up to the cradle of
the child Giglio, when everybody was admiring
him and complimenting his royal papa and mamma,
and said, “My poor child, the best thing I can send
you is a little <em>misfortune</em>”; and this was all she
would utter, to the disgust of Giglio’s parents, who
died very soon after, when Giglio’s uncle took the
throne, as we read in Chapter I.</p>

<p>In like manner, when Cavolfiore, King of Crim
Tartary, had a christening of his only child, Rosalba,
the Fairy Blackstick, who had been invited,
was not more gracious than in Prince Giglio’s case.
Whilst everybody was expatiating over the beauty
of the darling child, and congratulating its parents,
the Fairy Blackstick looked very sadly at the baby
and its mother, and said, “My good woman (for the
Fairy was very familiar, and no more minded a
Queen than a washerwoman)—my good woman,
these people who are following you will be the first
to turn against you; and as for this little lady, the
best thing I can wish her is a <em>little misfortune</em>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
So she touched Rosalba with her black wand, looked
severely at the courtiers, motioned the Queen an
adieu with her hand, and sailed slowly up into the
air out of the window.</p>

<p>When she was gone, the Court people, who had
been awed and silent in her presence, began to
speak. “What an odious Fairy she is (they said)—a
pretty Fairy, indeed! Why, she went to the
King of Paflagonia’s christening, and pretended to
do all sorts of things for that family; and what has
happened—the Prince, her godson, has been turned
off his throne by his uncle. Would we allow our
sweet Princess to be deprived of her rights by any
enemy? Never, never, never, never!”</p>

<p>And they all shouted in a chorus, “Never, never,
never, never!”</p>

<p>Now, I should like to know, and how did these
fine courtiers show their fidelity? One of King
Cavolfiore’s vassals, the Duke Padella just mentioned,
rebelled against the King, who went out to
chastise his rebellious subject. “Any one rebel
against our beloved and august Monarch!” cried
the courtiers; “any one resist <em>him</em>? Pooh! He is
invincible, irresistible. He will bring home Padella
a prisoner, and tie him to a donkey’s tail, and drive
him round the town, saying, ‘This is the way the
Great Cavolfiore treats rebels.’”</p>

<p>The King went forth to vanquish Padella; and
the poor Queen, who was a very timid, anxious
creature, grew so frightened and ill, that I am sorry
to say she died; leaving injunctions with her ladies
to take care of the dear little Rosalba. Of course
they said they would. Of course they vowed they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
would die rather than any harm should happen to
the Princess. At first the <cite>Crim Tartar Court
Journal</cite> stated that the King was obtaining great
victories over the audacious rebel: then it was announced
that the troops of the infamous Padella
were in flight: then it was said that the royal army
would soon come up with the enemy, and then—then
the news came that King Cavolfiore was vanquished
and slain by His Majesty, King Padella
the First!</p>

<p>At this news, half the courtiers ran off to pay
their duty to the conquering chief, and the other
half ran away, laying hands on all the best articles
in the palace; and poor little Rosalba was left there
quite alone—quite alone; and she toddled from one
room to another, crying, “Countess! Duchess!”
(only she said “Tountess, Duttess,” not being able
to speak plain) “bring me my mutton sop; my
Royal Highness hungy! Tountess! Duttess!” And
she went from the private apartments into the
throne room and nobody was there—and thence
into the ball-room and nobody was there—and
thence into the pages’ room and nobody was there—and
she toddled down the great staircase into the
hall and nobody was there—and the door was
open, and she went into the court, and into the garden,
and thence into the wilderness, and thence into
the forest where the wild beasts live and was never
heard of any more!</p>

<p class="tb">A piece of her torn mantle and one of her shoes
were found in the wood in the mouths of two lionesses’
cubs, whom King Padella and a royal hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
party shot—for he was King now, and reigned
over Crim Tartary. “So the poor little Princess
is done for,” said he; “well, what’s done can’t be
helped. Gentlemen, let us go to luncheon!” And
one of the courtiers took up the shoe and put it in
his pocket. And there was an end of Rosalba!</p>

<h3 id="ch4">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW BLACKSTICK WAS NOT ASKED TO THE PRINCESS
ANGELICA’S CHRISTENING</span></h3>

<p>When the Princess Angelica was born, her
parents not only did not ask the Fairy Blackstick
to the christening party, but gave orders to their
porter absolutely to refuse her if she called. This
porter’s name was Gruffanuff, and he had been
selected for the post by their Royal Highnesses because
he was a very tall fierce man, who could say
“Not at home” to a tradesman or an unwelcome
visitor with a rudeness which frightened most such
persons away. He was the husband of that Countess
whose picture we have just seen, and as long as
they were together they quarrelled from morning
till night. Now this fellow tried his rudeness once
too often, as you shall hear. For the Fairy Blackstick
coming to call upon the Prince and Princess,
who were actually sitting at the open drawing-room
window, Gruffanuff not only denied them, but
made the most <em>odious vulgar sign</em> as he was going
to slam the door in the Fairy’s face! “Git away,
hold Blackstick!” said he. “I tell you, Master and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
Missis ain’t at home to you;” and he was, as we
have said, <em>going</em> to slam the door.</p>

<p>But the Fairy, with her wand, prevented the door
being shut; and Gruffanuff came out again in a
fury, swearing in the most abominable way, and
asking the Fairy “whether she thought he was a
going to stay at that there door hall day?”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> going to stay at that door all day and
all night, and for many a long year,” the Fairy
said, very majestically; and Gruffanuff, coming
out of the door, straddling before it with his great
calves, burst out laughing, and cried “Ha, ha, ha!
this <em>is</em> a good un! Ha—ah—what’s this? Let me
down—O—o—H’m!” and then he was dumb!</p>

<p>For, as the Fairy waved her wand over him, he
felt himself rising off the ground, and fluttering up
against the door, and then, as if a screw ran into
his stomach, he felt a dreadful pain there, and was
pinned to the door; and then his arms flew up over
his head; and his legs, after writhing about wildly,
twisted under his body; and he felt cold, cold,
growing over him, as if he was turning into metal;
and he said, “O—o—H’m!” and could say no more,
because he was dumb.</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> turned into metal! He was, from being
<em>brazen</em>, <em>brass</em>! He was neither more nor less than
a knocker! And there he was, nailed to the door
in the blazing summer day, till he burned almost
red-hot; and there he was, nailed to the door all the
bitter winter nights, till his brass nose was dropping
with icicles. And the postman came and rapped
at him, and the vulgarest boy with a letter came
and hit him up against the door. And the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and Queen (Princess and Prince they were then)
coming home from a walk that evening, the King
said, “Hullo, my dear! you have had a new knocker
put on the door. Why, it’s rather like our porter
in the face! What has become of that boozy vagabond?”
And the housemaid came and scrubbed his
nose with sand-paper; and
once, when the Princess
Angelica’s little sister was
born, he was tied up in an
old kid glove; and, another
night, some <em>larking</em> young
men tried to wrench him
off, and put him to the
most excruciating agony
with a turnscrew. And
then the Queen had a fancy
to have the color of the
door altered; and the painters
dabbed him over the
mouth and eyes, and nearly
choked him, as they painted him pea-green. I warrant
he had leisure to repent of having been rude
to the Fairy Blackstick!</p>

<p class="tb">As for his wife, she did not miss him; and as he
was always guzzling beer at the public-house, and
notoriously quarrelling with his wife, and in debt
to the tradesmen, it was supposed he had run away
from all these evils, and emigrated to Australia or
America. And when the Prince and Princess chose
to become King and Queen, they left their old
house, and nobody thought of the porter any more.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW PRINCESS ANGELICA TOOK A LITTLE MAID</span></h3>

<p>One day, when the Princess Angelica was quite
a little girl, she was walking in the garden of the
palace, with Mrs. Gruffanuff, the governess, holding
a parasol over her head, to keep her sweet complexion
from the freckles, and Angelica was carrying
a bun, to feed the swans and ducks in the royal
pond.</p>

<p>They had not reached the duck-pond, when there
came toddling up to them such a funny little girl!
She had a great quantity of hair blowing about her
chubby little cheeks, and looked as if she had not
been washed or combed for ever so long. She wore
a ragged bit of a cloak, and had only one shoe on.</p>

<p>“You little wretch, who let you in here?” asked
Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“Div me dat bun,” said the little girl, “me vely
hungy.”</p>

<p>“Hungry! what is that?” asked Princess Angelica,
and gave the child the bun.</p>

<p>“Oh, Princess!” says Gruffanuff, “how good,
how kind, how truly angelical you are! See, your
Majesties,” she said to the King and Queen, who
now came up, along with their nephew, Prince
Giglio, “how kind the Princess is! She met this
little dirty wretch in the garden—I can’t tell how
she came in here, or why the guards did not shoot
her dead at the gate!—and the dear darling of a
Princess has given her the whole of her bun!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want it,” said Angelica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you are a darling little angel all the same,”
says the governess.</p>

<p>“Yes; I know I am,” said Angelica. “Dirty little
girl, don’t you think I am very pretty?” Indeed,
she had on
the finest of little
dresses and hats;
and, as her hair
was carefully
curled, she really
looked very well.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray6.jpg" width="225" height="275" alt="The royal family meet a little girl in the garden" />
</div>

<p>“Oh, pooty,
pooty!” says the
little girl, capering
about, laughing,
and dancing,
and munching
her bun; and as
she ate it she began
to sing, “Oh,
what fun to have
a plum bun! how
I wis it never was done!” At which, and her
funny accent, Angelica, Giglio, and the King and
Queen began to laugh very merrily.</p>

<p>“I can dance as well as sing,” says the little girl.
“I can dance, and I can sing, and I can do all sorts
of ting.”</p>

<p>And she ran to a flower-bed, and pulling a few
polyanthuses, rhododendrons, and other flowers,
made herself a little wreath, and danced before the
King and Queen so drolly and prettily, that everybody
was delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was your mother—who were your relations,
little girl?” said the Queen.</p>

<p>The little girl said, “Little lion was my brudder;
great big lioness my mudder; neber heard of any
udder.” And she capered away on her one shoe,
and everybody was exceedingly diverted.</p>

<p>So Angelica said to the Queen, “Mamma, my
parrot flew away yesterday out of its cage, and I
don’t care any more for any of my toys; and I think
this funny little dirty child will amuse me. I will
take her home, and give her some of my old frocks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the generous darling!” says Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“Which I have worn ever so many times, and
am quite tired of,” Angelica went on; “and she
shall be my little maid. Will you come home with
me, little dirty girl?” The child clapped her hands,
and said, “Go home with you—yes! You pooty Princess!—Have
a nice dinner, and wear a new dress!”
And they all laughed again, and took home the
child to the palace, where, when she was washed
and combed, and had one of the Princess’s frocks
given to her, she looked as handsome as Angelica,
almost. Not that Angelica ever thought so; for
this little lady never imagined that anybody in the
world could be as pretty, as good, or as clever as
herself. In order that the little girl should not become
too proud and conceited, Mrs. Gruffanuff
took her old ragged mantle and one shoe, and put
them into a glass box, with a card laid upon them,
upon which was written, “These were the old
clothes in which little Betsinda was found when the
great goodness and admirable kindness of her
Royal Highness the Princess Angelica received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
this little outcast.” And the date was added, and
the box locked up.</p>

<p>For a while little Betsinda was a great favorite
with the Princess, and she danced, and sang, and
made her little rhymes, to amuse her mistress. But
then the Princess got a monkey, and afterwards
a little dog, and afterwards a doll, and did not care
for Betsinda any more, who became very melancholy
and quiet, and sang no more funny songs,
because nobody cared to hear her. And then, as
she grew older, she was made a little lady’s-maid
to the Princess; and though she had no wages, she
worked and mended, and put Angelica’s hair in
papers, and was never cross when scolded, and was
always eager to please her mistress, and was always
up early and to bed late, and at hand when wanted,
and in fact became a perfect little maid. So the
two girls grew up, and, when the Princess came
out, Betsinda was never tired of waiting on her;
and made her dresses better than the best milliner,
and was useful in a hundred ways. Whilst the
Princess was having her masters, Betsinda would
sit and watch them; and in this way she picked up a
great deal of learning; for she was always awake,
though her mistress was not, and listened to the
wise professors when Angelica was yawning or
thinking of the next ball. And when the dancing-master
came, Betsinda learned along with Angelica;
and when the music-master came, she
watched him, and practised the Princess’s pieces
when Angelica was away at balls and parties; and
when the drawing-master came, she took note of all
he said and did; and the same with French, Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
and all other languages—she learned them from
the teacher who came to Angelica. When the
Princess was going out of an evening she would
say, “My good Betsinda, you may as well finish
what I have begun.” “Yes, miss,” Betsinda would
say, and sit down very cheerful, not to <em>finish</em> what
Angelica begun, but to <em>do</em> it. For instance, the Princess
would begin a head of a warrior, let us say, and
when it was begun it was something like this—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/thackeray7.jpg" width="120" height="200" alt="The warrior before" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">But when it was done, the warrior was like this—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/thackeray8.jpg" width="120" height="200" alt="The warrior after" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">(only handsomer still if possible), and the Princess
put her name to the drawing; and the Court and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
King and Queen, and above all poor Giglio, admired
the picture of all things, and said, “Was there
ever a genius like Angelica?” So, I am sorry to say,
was it with the Princess’s embroidery and other accomplishments;
and Angelica actually believed that
she did these things herself, and received all the
flattery of the Court as if every word of it was true.
Thus she began to think that there was no young
woman in all the world equal to herself, and that no
young man was good enough for her. As for Betsinda,
as she heard none of these praises, she was
not puffed up by them, and being a most grateful,
good-natured girl, she was only too anxious to do
everything which might give her mistress pleasure.
Now you begin to perceive that Angelica had faults
of her own, and was by no means such a wonder
of wonders as people represented Her Royal Highness
to be.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW PRINCE GIGLIO BEHAVED HIMSELF</span></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray9.jpg" width="225" height="350" alt="The Lord Chancellor of Paflagonia, looking displeased" />
</div>

<p>And now let us speak about Prince Giglio, the
nephew of the reigning monarch of Paflagonia.
It has already been stated, in <a href="#Page_398">page 398</a>, that as
long as he had a smart coat to wear, a good horse
to ride, and money in his pocket, or rather to take
out of his pocket, for he was very good-natured,
my young Prince did not care for the loss of his
crown and scepter, being a thoughtless youth, not
much inclined to politics or any kind of learning.
So his tutor had a sinecure. Giglio would not learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
classics or mathematics, and the Lord Chancellor of
Paflagonia, Squaretoso, pulled a very long face because
the Prince could not be got to study the Paflagonian
laws and constitution; but, on the other
hand, the King’s gamekeepers and huntsmen found
the Prince an apt pupil; the dancing-master pronounced
that he was a most elegant and assiduous
scholar; the First Lord of
the Billiard Table gave
the most flattering reports
of the Prince’s
skill; so did the Groom of
the Tennis Court; and as
for the Captain of the
Guard and Fencing Master,
the <em>valiant</em> and <em>veteran</em>
Count Kutasoff
Hedzoff, he avowed that
since he ran the General
of Crim Tartary, the
dreadful Grumbuskin,
through the body, he
never had encountered so
expert a swordsman as
Prince Giglio.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/thackeray10.jpg" width="175" height="400" alt="Prince Giglio" />
</div>

<p>I hope you do not imagine that there was any impropriety
in the Prince and Princess walking together
in the palace garden, and because Giglio
kissed Angelica’s hand in a polite manner. In
the first place they are cousins; next, the Queen is
walking in the garden too (you cannot see her, for
she happens to be behind that tree), and Her Majesty
always wished that Angelica and Giglio should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
marry; so did Giglio: so did Angelica sometimes,
for she thought her cousin very handsome, brave,
and good-natured: but then you know she was so
clever and knew so many
things, and poor Giglio knew
nothing, and had no conversation.
When they looked at
the stars, what did Giglio
know of the heavenly bodies?
Once, when on a sweet night
in a balcony where they
were standing, Angelica said,
“There is the Bear.” “Where?”
says Giglio. “Don’t be afraid,
Angelica! if a dozen bears
come, I will kill them rather
than they shall hurt you.”
“Oh, you silly creature!” says
she; “you are very good, but
you are not very wise.” When
they looked at the flowers,
Giglio was utterly unacquainted
with botany, and had
never heard of Linnæus. When the butterflies
passed, Giglio knew nothing about them, being as
ignorant of entomology as I am of algebra. So
you see, Angelica, though she liked Giglio pretty
well, despised him on account of his ignorance. I
think she probably valued <em>her own learning</em> rather
too much; but to think too well of one’s self is the
fault of people of all ages and both sexes. Finally,
when nobody else was there, Angelica liked her
cousin well enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray11.jpg" width="225" height="250" alt="Giglio and Angelica courting in the garden" />
</div>

<p>King Valoroso was very delicate in health, and
withal so fond of good dinners (which were prepared
for him by his French cook Marmitonio),
that is was supposed he could not live long. Now
the idea of anything happening to the King struck
the artful Prime Minister and the designing old
lady-in-waiting with terror. For, thought Glumboso
and the Countess,
“when Prince
Giglio marries his
cousin and comes to
the throne, what a
pretty position we
shall be in, whom he
dislikes, and who
have always been
unkind to him. We
shall lose our places
in a trice; Gruffanuff
will have to
give up all the jewels,
laces, snuffboxes,
rings, and
watches which belonged to the Queen, Giglio’s
mother, and Glumboso will be forced to refund
two hundred and seventeen thousand millions
nine hundred and eighty-seven thousand four
hundred and thirty-nine pounds, thirteen shillings,
and sixpence halfpenny, money left to Prince
Giglio by his poor dear father.” So the Lady of
Honor and the Prime Minister hated Giglio because
they had done him a wrong; and these unprincipled
people invented a hundred cruel stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
about poor Giglio, in order to influence the King,
Queen, and Princess against him; how he was so
ignorant that he could not spell the commonest
words, and actually wrote Valoroso Valloroso, and
spelt Angelica with two I’s; how he drank a great
deal too much wine at dinner, and was always idling
in the stables with the grooms; how he owed ever so
much money at the pastrycook’s and haberdasher’s;
how he used to go to sleep at church; how he was
fond of playing cards with the pages. So did the
Queen like playing cards; so did the King go to
sleep at church, and eat and drink too much; and, if
Giglio owed a trifle for tarts, who owed him two
hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred
and eighty-seven thousand four hundred and
thirty-nine pounds, thirteen shillings, and sixpence
halfpenny, I should like to know? Detractors and
tale-bearers (in my humble opinion) had much better
look at home. All this backbiting and slandering
had effect upon Princess Angelica, who began
to look coldly on her cousin, then to laugh at him
and scorn him for being so stupid, then to sneer at
him for having vulgar associates; and at Court
balls, dinners, and so forth, to treat him so unkindly
that poor Giglio became quite ill, took to his bed,
and sent for the doctor.</p>

<p>His Majesty King Valoroso, as we have seen,
had his own reasons for disliking his nephew; and
as for those innocent readers who ask why?—I beg
(with the permission of their dear parents) to refer
them to Shakespeare’s pages, where they will read
why King John disliked Prince Arthur. With
the Queen, his royal but weak-minded aunt, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Giglio was out of sight he was out of mind. While
she had her whist and her evening parties, she cared
for little else.</p>

<p>I dare say <em>two villains</em>, who shall be nameless,
wished Doctor Pildrafto, the Court Physician, had
killed Giglio right out, but he only bled and physicked
him so severely that the Prince was kept to
his room for several months, and grew as thin as a
post.</p>

<p>Whilst he was lying sick in this way, there came
to the Court of Paflagonia a famous painter, whose
name was Tomaso Lorenzo, and who was Painter
in Ordinary to the King of Crim Tartary, Paflagonia’s
neighbor. Tomaso Lorenzo painted all
the Court, who were delighted with his works; for
even Countess Gruffanuff looked young and
Glumboso good-humored in his pictures. “He flatters
very much,” some people said. “Nay!” says
Princess Angelica, “I am above flattery, and I
think he did not make my picture handsome
enough. I can’t bear to hear a man of genius unjustly
cried down, and I hope my dear papa will
make Lorenzo a knight of his Order of the Cucumber.”</p>

<p>The Princess Angelica, although the courtiers
vowed Her Royal Highness could draw so <em>beautifully</em>
that the idea of her taking lessons was absurd,
yet chose to have Lorenzo for a teacher, and it was
wonderful, <em>as long as she painted in his studio</em>,
what beautiful pictures she made! Some of the
performances were engraved for the Book of Beauty;
others were sold for enormous sums at Charity
Bazaars. She wrote the <em>signatures</em> under the drawings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
no doubt, but I think I know who did the pictures—this
artful painter, who had come with other
designs on Angelica than merely to teach her to
draw.</p>

<p>One day, Lorenzo showed the Princess a portrait
of a young man in armor, with fair hair and the
loveliest blue eyes, and an expression at once melancholy
and interesting.</p>

<p>“Dear Signor Lorenzo, who is this?” asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>“I never saw any one so handsome,” says Countess
Gruffanuff (the old humbug).</p>

<p>“That,” said the painter, “that, madam, is the
portrait of my august young master, His Royal
Highness Bulbo, Crown Prince of Crim Tartary,
Duke of Acroceraunia, Marquis of Poluphloisboio,
and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the
Pumpkin. That is the Order of the Pumpkin glittering
on his manly breast, and received by His
Royal Highness from his august father, His Majesty
King Padella I., for his gallantry at the battle
of Rimbombamento, when he slew with his own
princely hand the King of Ograria and two hundred
and eleven giants of the two hundred and
eighteen who formed the King’s bodyguard. The
remainder were destroyed by the brave Crim
Tartar army after an obstinate combat, in which
the Crim Tartars suffered severely.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray12.jpg" width="225" height="350" alt="Giglio and Angelica looking at the portrait of Bulbo" />
</div>

<p>What a Prince! thought Angelica: so brave—so
calm-looking—so young—what a hero!</p>

<p>“He is as accomplished as he is brave,” continued
the Court Painter. “He knows all languages perfectly:
sings deliciously: plays every instrument:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
composes operas which have been acted a thousand
nights running at the Imperial Theatre of Crim
Tartary, and danced in a ballet there before the
King and Queen; in which he looked so beautiful,
that his cousin, the lovely daughter of the King of
Circassia, died for love of him.”</p>

<p>“Why did he not marry the poor Princess?”
asked Angelica, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Because they were <em>first cousins</em>, madam, and
the clergy forbid these unions,” said the Painter.</p>

<p>“And, besides, the young
Prince had given his
royal heart <em>elsewhere</em>.”</p>

<p>“And to whom?”
asked Her Royal Highness.</p>

<p>“I am not at liberty to
mention the Princess’s
name,” answered the
Painter.</p>

<p>“But you may tell me
the first letter of it,”
gasped out the Princess.</p>

<p>“That your Royal
Highness is at liberty to
guess,” says Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“Does it begin with a
Z?” asked Angelica.</p>

<p>The Painter said it wasn’t a Z; then she tried a
Y; then an X; then a W, and went so backwards
through almost the whole alphabet.</p>

<p>When she came to D, and it wasn’t D, she grew
very much excited; when she came to C, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
wasn’t C, she was still more nervous; when she came
to B, <em>and it wasn’t B</em>, “O dearest Gruffanuff,” she
said, “lend me your smelling-bottle!” and, hiding
her head in the Countess’s shoulder, she faintly
whispered, “Ah, Signor, can it be A?”</p>

<p>“It was A; and though I may not, by my Royal
Master’s orders, tell your Royal Highness the
Princess’s name, whom he fondly, madly, devotedly,
rapturously loves, I may show you her
portrait,” says this slyboots: and leading the Princess
up to a gilt frame, he drew a curtain which was
before it.</p>

<p>O goodness! the frame contained a <span class="smcapuc">LOOKING-GLASS</span>!
and Angelica saw her own face!</p>

<h3 id="ch7">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW GIGLIO AND ANGELICA HAD A QUARREL</span></h3>

<p>The Court Painter of His Majesty the King of
Crim Tartary returned to that monarch’s dominions,
carrying away a number of sketches which he
had made in the Paflagonian capital (you know, of
course, my dears, that the name of that capital is
Blombodinga); but the most charming of all his
pieces was a portrait of the Princess Angelica,
which all the Crim Tartar nobles came to see. With
this work the King was so delighted, that he decorated
the Painter with his Order of the Pumpkin
(sixth class), and the artist became Sir Tomaso
Lorenzo, K. P., thenceforth.</p>

<p>King Valoroso also sent Sir Tomaso his Order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
of the Cucumber, besides a handsome order for
money, for he painted the King, Queen, and principal
nobility while at Blombodinga, and became
all the fashion, to the perfect rage of all the artists
in Paflagonia, where the King used to point to the
portrait of Prince Bulbo, which Sir Tomaso had
left behind him, and say, “Which among you can
paint a picture like that?”</p>

<p>It hung in the royal parlor over the royal sideboard,
and Princess Angelica could always look at
it as she sat making the tea. Each day it seemed
to grow handsomer and handsomer, and the Princess
grew so fond of looking at it, that she would
often spill the tea over the cloth, at which her father
and mother would wink and wag their heads, and
say to each other, “Aha! we see how things are
going.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile poor Giglio lay upstairs very
sick in his chamber, though he took all the doctor’s
horrible medicines like a good young lad; as I hope
<em>you</em> do, my dears, when you are ill and mamma
sends for the medical man. And the only person
who visited Giglio (besides his friend the captain
of the guard, who was almost always busy or on
parade), was little Betsinda the housemaid, who
used to do his bedroom and sitting-room out, bring
him his gruel, and warm his bed.</p>

<p>When the little housemaid came to him in
the morning and evening, Prince Giglio used
to say, “Betsinda, Betsinda, how is the Princess
Angelica?”</p>

<p>And Betsinda used to answer, “The Princess is
very well, thank you, my Lord.” And Giglio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
would heave a sigh, and think, if Angelica were
sick, I am sure <em>I</em> should not be very well.</p>

<p>Then Giglio would say, “Betsinda, has the Princess
Angelica asked for me to-day?” And Betsinda
would answer, “No, my Lord, not to-day”;
or, “She was very busy practising the piano when
I saw her”; or, “She was writing invitations for an
evening party, and did not speak to me”; or make
some excuse or other, not strictly consonant with
truth; for Betsinda was such a good-natured creature,
that she strove to do everything to prevent
annoyance to Prince Giglio, and even brought him
up roast chicken and jellies from the kitchen (when
the Doctor allowed them, and Giglio was getting
better), saying, “that the Princess had made the
jelly, or the bread-sauce, with her own hands, on
purpose for Giglio.”</p>

<p>When Giglio heard this he took heart and began
to mend immediately; and gobbled up the jelly,
and picked the last bone of the chicken-drumsticks,
merry-thought, sides’-bones, back, pope’s
nose, and all—thanking his dear Angelica; and
he felt so much better the next day, that he dressed
and went downstairs, where, whom should he meet
but Angelica going into the drawing-room! All
the covers were off the chairs, the chandeliers taken
out of the bags, the damask curtains uncovered,
the work and things carried away, and the handsomest
albums on the table. Angelica had her
hair in papers: in a word, it was evident there was
going to be a party.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Giglio!” cries Angelica: “<em>you</em> here in
such a dress! What a figure you are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear Angelica, I am come downstairs, and
feel so well to-day, thanks to the <em>fowl</em> and the
<em>jelly</em>.”</p>

<p>“What do I know about fowls and jellies, that
you allude to them in that rude way?” says
Angelica.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t—didn’t you send them, Angelica
dear?” says Giglio.</p>

<p>“I send them indeed! Angelica dear! No, Giglio
dear,” says she, mocking him, “<em>I</em> was engaged
in getting the rooms ready for His Royal Highness
the Prince of Crim Tartary, who is coming to
pay my papa’s Court a visit.”</p>

<p>“The—Prince—of—Crim—Tartary!” Giglio
said, aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Prince of Crim Tartary,” says Angelica,
mocking him. “I dare say you never heard of
such a country. What <em>did</em> you ever hear of? You
don’t know whether Crim Tartary is on the Red
Sea or on the Black Sea, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, it’s on the Red Sea,” says Giglio, at
which the Princess burst out laughing at him, and
said, “Oh, you ninny! You are so ignorant, you
are really not fit for society! You know nothing
but about horses and dogs, and are only fit to dine
in a mess-room with my Royal father’s heaviest
dragoons. Don’t look so surprised at me, sir: go
and put your best clothes on to receive the Prince,
and let me get the drawing-room ready.”</p>

<p>Giglio said, “Oh, Angelica, I didn’t think this
of you. <em>This</em> wasn’t your language to me when
you gave me this ring, and I gave you mine in the
garden, and you gave me that k—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>But what k was we never shall know, for Angelica,
in a rage, cried, “Get out, you saucy, rude creature!
How dare you to remind me of your rudeness?
As for your little trumpery twopenny ring,
there, sir, there!” And she flung it out of the
window.</p>

<p>“It was my mother’s marriage-ring,” cried
Giglio.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> don’t care whose marriage-ring it was,” cries
Angelica. “Marry the person who picks it up if
she’s a woman; you shan’t marry <em>me</em>. And give me
back <em>my</em> ring. I’ve no patience with people who
boast about the things they give away. <em>I</em> know
who’ll give me much finer things than you ever gave
me. A beggarly ring indeed, not worth five
shillings!”</p>

<p>Now Angelica little knew that the ring which
Giglio had given her was a fairy ring: if a man
wore it, it made all the women in love with him; if
a woman, all the gentlemen. The Queen, Giglio’s
mother, quite an ordinary-looking person, was admired
immensely whilst she wore this ring, and her
husband was frantic when she was ill. But when
she called her little Giglio to her, and put the ring
on his finger, King Savio did not seem to care for
his wife so much any more, but transferred all his
love to little Giglio.</p>

<p>So did everybody love him as long as he had
the ring; but when, as quite a child, he gave it to
Angelica people began to love and admire <em>her</em>;
and Giglio, as the saying is, played only second
fiddle.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Angelica, going on in her foolish ungrateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
way. “<em>I</em> know who’ll give me much finer
things than your beggarly little pearl nonsense.”
“Very good, miss! You may take back your
ring too!” says Giglio, his eyes flashing fire at her
and then, as if his eyes had been suddenly opened,
he cried out, “Ha! what does this mean? Is <em>this</em>
the woman I have been in love with all my life?
Have I been such a ninny as to throw away my
regard upon <em>you</em>? Why—actually—yes—you are
a little crooked!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wretch!” cries Angelica.</p>

<p>“And, upon my conscience, you—you squint a
little.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” cries Angelica.</p>

<p>“And your hair is red—and you are marked with
the smallpox—and what? you have three false teeth—and
one leg shorter than the other!”</p>

<p>“You brute, you brute, you!” Angelica screamed
out; and as she seized the ring with one hand, she
dealt Giglio one, two, three smacks on the face,
and would have pulled the hair off his head had
he not started laughing, and crying—</p>

<p>“Oh dear me, Angelica, don’t pull out <em>my</em> hair,
it hurts! You might remove a great deal of <em>your
own</em>, as I perceive, without scissors or pulling at all.
Oh, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha! he, he, he!”</p>

<p>And he nearly choked himself with laughing, and
she with rage; when, with a low bow, and dressed
in his Court habit, Count Gambabella, the first
lord-in-waiting, entered and said, “Royal Highnesses!
Their Majesties expect you in the Pink
Throne-room, where they await the arrival of the
Prince of Crim Tartary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="ch8">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW GRUFFANUFF PICKED THE FAIRY RING UP, AND PRINCE BULBO CAME TO COURT</span></h3>

<p>Prince Bulbo’s arrival had set all the Court in
a flutter: everybody was ordered to put his or her
best clothes on: the footmen had their gala liveries;
the Lord Chancellor his new wig; the Guards their
last new tunics; and Countess Gruffanuff, you may
be sure, was glad of an opportunity of decorating
<em>her</em> old person with her finest things. She was
walking through the court of the Palace on her
way to wait upon their Majesties, when she spied
something glittering on the pavement, and bade
the boy in buttons who was holding up her train,
to go and pick up the article shining yonder. He
was an ugly little wretch, in some of the late groom-porter’s
old clothes cut down, and much too tight
for him; and yet, when he had taken up the ring
(as it turned out to be), and was carrying it to
his mistress, she thought he looked like a little
Cupid. He gave the ring to her; it was a trumpery
little thing enough, but too small for any of her
old knuckles, so she put it into her pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, mum!” says the boy, looking at her, “how—how
beyoutiful you do look, mum, to-day, mum!”</p>

<p>“And you, too, Jacky,” she was going to say;
but, looking down at him—no, he was no longer
good-looking at all—but only the carroty-haired
little Jacky of the morning. However, praise is
welcome from the ugliest of men or boys, and
Gruffanuff, bidding the boy hold up her train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
walked on in high good-humor. The guards saluted
her with peculiar respect. Captain Hedzoff,
in the ante-room, said, “My dear madam, you look
like an angel to-day.” And so, bowing and smirking,
Gruffanuff went in and took her place behind
her Royal Master and Mistress, who were in the
throne-room, awaiting the Prince of Crim Tartary.
Princess Angelica sat at their feet, and behind the
King’s chair stood Prince Giglio, looking very
savage.</p>

<p>The Prince of Crim Tartary made his appearance,
attended by Baron Sleibootz, his chamberlain,
and followed by a black page carrying the most
beautiful crown you ever saw! He was dressed in
his travelling costume, and his hair, as you see,
was a little in disorder. “I have ridden three hundred
miles since breakfast,” said he, “so eager was
I to behold the Prin—the Court and august family
of Paflagonia, and I could not wait one minute
before appearing in your Majesties’ presences.”</p>

<p>Giglio, from behind the throne, burst out into a
roar of contemptuous laughter; but all the Royal
party, in fact, were so flurried, that they did not
hear this little outbreak. “Your R. H. is welcome
in any dress,” says the King. “Glumboso, a chair
for His Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>“Any dress His Royal Highness wears <em>is</em> a Court
dress,” says Princess Angelica, smiling graciously.</p>

<p>“Ah! but you should see my other clothes,” said
the Prince. “I should have had them on, but that
stupid carrier has not brought them. Who’s that
laughing?”</p>

<p>It was Giglio laughing. “I was laughing,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
said, “because you said just now that you were in
such a hurry to see the Princess, that you could not
wait to change your dress; and now you say you
come in those clothes because you have no others.”</p>

<p>“And who are you?” says Prince Bulbo, very
fiercely.</p>

<p>“My father was King of this country, and I am
his only son, Prince!” replies Giglio, with equal
haughtiness.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the King and Glumboso, looking
very flurried; but the former, collecting himself,
said, “Dear Prince Bulbo, I forgot to introduce to
your Royal Highness my dear nephew, His Royal
Highness Prince Giglio! Know each other! Embrace
each other! Giglio, give His Royal Highness
your hand!” and Giglio, giving his hand,
squeezed poor Bulbo’s until the tears ran out of
his eyes. Glumboso now brought a chair for
the royal visitor, and placed it on the platform on
which the King, Queen, and Prince were seated;
but the chair was on the edge of the platform,
and as Bulbo sat down, it toppled over, and he
with it, rolling over and over, and bellowing like a
bull. Giglio roared still louder at this disaster,
but it was with laughter; so did all the Court when
Prince Bulbo got up; for though when he entered
the room he appeared not very ridiculous, as he
stood up from his fall for a moment he looked so
exceedingly plain and foolish, that nobody could
help laughing at him. When he had entered the
room, he was observed to carry a rose in his hand,
which fell out of it as he tumbled.</p>

<p>“My rose! my rose!” cried Bulbo; and his chamberlain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
dashed forwards and picked it up; and gave
it to the Prince, who put it in his waistcoat. Then
people wondered why they had laughed; there was
nothing particularly ridiculous in him. He was
rather short, rather stout, rather red-haired, but,
in fine, for a Prince, not so bad.</p>

<p>So they sat and talked, the royal personages together,
the Crim Tartar officers with those of Paflagonia—Giglio
very comfortable with Gruffanuff
behind the throne. He looked at her with such
tender eyes, that her heart was all in a flutter. “Oh,
dear Prince,” she said, “how could you speak so
haughtily in presence of their Majesties? I protest
I thought I should have fainted.”</p>

<p>“I should have caught you in my arms,” said
Giglio, looking raptures.</p>

<p>“Why were you so cruel to Prince Bulbo, dear
Prince?” says Gruff.</p>

<p>“Because I hate him,” says Gil.</p>

<p>“You are jealous of him, and still love poor
Angelica,” cries Gruffanuff, putting her handkerchief
to her eyes.</p>

<p>“I did, but I love her no more!” Giglio cried.
“I despise her! Were she heiress to twenty thousand
thrones I would despise her and scorn her.
But why speak of thrones? I have lost mine. I am
too weak to recover it—I am alone, and have no
friend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so, dear Prince!” says Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“Besides,” says he, “I am so happy here <em>behind
the throne</em> that I would not change my place, no,
not for the throne of the world!”</p>

<p>“What are you two people chattering about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
there?” says the Queen, who was rather good-natured,
though not overburthened with wisdom. “It
is time to dress for dinner. Giglio, show Prince
Bulbo to his room. Prince, if your clothes have
not come, we shall be very happy to see you as you
are.” But when Prince Bulbo got to his bedroom,
his luggage was there and unpacked; and the hairdresser
coming in, cut and curled him entirely to
his own satisfaction; and when the dinner-bell rang,
the royal company had not to wait above five-and-twenty
minutes until Bulbo appeared, during which
time the King, who could not bear to wait, grew as
sulky as possible. As for Giglio, he never left
Madam Gruffanuff all this time, but stood with
her in the embrasure of a window, paying her compliments.
At length the Groom of the Chambers
announced His Royal Highness the Prince of Crim
Tartary! and the noble company went into the
royal dining-room. It was quite a small party;
only the King and Queen, the Princess, whom Bulbo
took out, the two Princes, Countess Gruffanuff,
Glumboso the Prime Minister, and Prince Bulbo’s
chamberlain. You may be sure they had a very
good dinner—let every boy and girl think of what
he or she likes best, and fancy it on the table.</p>

<p>The Princess talked incessantly all dinner-time
to the Prince of Crimea, who ate an immense deal
too much, and never took his eyes off his plate,
except when Giglio, who was carving a goose, sent
a quantity of stuffing and onion sauce into one of
them. Giglio only burst out a-laughing as the
Crimean Prince wiped his shirt-front and face with
his scented pocket-handkerchief. He did not make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Prince Bulbo any apology. When the Prince
looked at him, Giglio would not look that way.
When Prince Bulbo said, “Prince Giglio, may I
have the honor of taking a glass of wine with you?”
Giglio <em>wouldn’t</em> answer. All his talk and his eyes
were for Countess Gruffanuff, who you may be
sure was pleased with Giglio’s attentions—the
vain old creature! When he was not complimenting
her, he was making fun of Prince Bulbo,
so loud that Gruffanuff was always tapping him
with her fan, and saying—“Oh, you satirical
Prince! Oh, fie, the Prince will hear!” “Well, I
don’t mind,” says Giglio, louder still. The King
and Queen luckily did not hear; for Her Majesty
was a little deaf, and the King thought so much
about his own dinner, and, besides, made such a
dreadful noise, hobgobbling in eating it, that he
heard nothing else. After dinner, His Majesty and
the Queen went to sleep in their arm-chairs.</p>

<p>This was the time when Giglio began his tricks
with Prince Bulbo, plying that young gentleman
with port, sherry, madeira, champagne, marsala,
cherry-brandy, and pale ale, of all of which Master
Bulbo drank without stint. But in plying his
guest, Giglio was obliged to drink himself, and, I
am sorry to say, took more than was good for him,
so that the young men were very noisy, rude, and
foolish when they joined the ladies after dinner;
and dearly did they pay for that imprudence, as
now, my darlings, you shall hear!</p>

<p>Bulbo went and sat by the piano, where Angelica
was playing and singing, and he sang out of tune,
and he upset the coffee when the footman brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
it, and he laughed out of place, and talked absurdly,
and fell asleep and snored horridly. Booh, the
nasty pig! But as he lay there stretched on the
pink satin sofa, Angelica still persisted in thinking
him the most beautiful of human beings. No doubt
the magic rose which Bulbo wore caused this infatuation
on Angelica’s part; but is she the first young
woman who has thought a silly fellow charming?</p>

<p>Giglio must go and sit by Gruffanuff, whose old
face he too every moment began to find more lovely.
He paid the most outrageous compliments to her:—There
never was such a darling—Older than he
was?—Fiddle-de-dee! He would marry her—he
would have nothing but her!</p>

<p>To marry the heir to the throne! Here was a
chance! The artful hussy actually got a sheet of
paper, and wrote upon it, “This is to give notice
that I, Giglio, only son of Savio, King of Paflagonia,
hereby promise to marry the charming and
virtuous Barbara Griselda, Countess Gruffanuff,
and widow of the late Jenkins Gruffanuff, Esq.”</p>

<p>“What is it you are writing, you charming
Gruffy?” says Giglio, who was lolling on the sofa,
by the writing-table.</p>

<p>“Only an order for you to sign, dear Prince,
for giving coals and blankets to the poor, this cold
weather. Look! the King and Queen are both
asleep, and your Royal Highness’s order will do.”</p>

<p>So Giglio, who was very good-natured, as Gruffy
well knew, signed the order immediately; and, when
she had it in her pocket, you may fancy what airs
she gave herself. She was ready to flounce out of
the room before the Queen herself, as now she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the wife of the <em>rightful</em> King of Paflagonia! She
would not speak to Glumboso, whom she thought a
brute, for depriving her <em>dear husband</em> of the crown!
And when candles came, and she had helped to
undress the Queen and Princess, she went into her
own room, and actually practised on a sheet of
paper, “Griselda Paflagonia,” “Barbara Regina,”
“Griselda Barbara, Paf. Reg.,” and I don’t know
what signatures besides, against the day when she
should be Queen, forsooth!</p>

<h3 id="ch9">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW BETSINDA GOT THE WARMING-PAN</span></h3>

<p>Little Betsinda came in to put Gruffanuff’s
hair in papers; and the Countess was so pleased,
that, for a wonder, she complimented Betsinda.
“Betsinda!” she said, “you dressed my hair very
nicely to-day; I promised you a little present.
Here are five sh—no, here is a pretty little ring,
that I picked—that I have had some time.” And
she gave Betsinda the ring she had picked up in the
court. It fitted Betsinda exactly.</p>

<p>“It’s like the ring the Princess used to wear,”
says the maid.</p>

<p>“No such thing,” says Gruffanuff, “I have had it
this ever so long. There, tuck me up quite comfortable;
and now, as it’s a very cold night (the
snow was beating in at the window), you may go
and warm dear Prince Giglio’s bed, like a good
girl, and then you may unrip my green silk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
then you can just do me up a little cap for the
morning, and then you can mend that hole in my
silk stocking, and then you can go to bed, Betsinda.
Mind I shall want my cup of tea at five o’clock in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I had best warm both the young gentlemen’s
beds, ma’am,” says Betsinda.</p>

<p>Gruffanuff, for reply, said, “Hau-au-ho!—Grau-haw-hoo!-Hong-hrho!”
In fact, she was snoring
sound asleep.</p>

<p>Her room, you know, is next to the King and
Queen, and the Princess is next to them. So pretty
Betsinda went away for the coals to the kitchen,
and filled the royal warming-pan.</p>

<p>Now, she was a very kind, merry, civil, pretty
girl; but there must have been something very captivating
about her this evening, for all the women
in the servants’ hall began to scold and abuse her.
The housekeeper said she was a pert, stuck-up
thing: the upper-housemaid asked how dare she
wear such ringlets and ribbons, it was quite improper!
The cook (for there was a woman-cook as
well as a man-cook) said to the kitchen-maid that
<em>she</em> never could see anything in that creetur: but as
for the men, every one of them, Coachman, John,
Buttons the page, and Monsieur, the Prince of
Crim Tartary’s valet, started up, and said:</p>

<table class="nopad">

    <td>}</td>
    <td rowspan="4" class="valign">What a pretty girl Betsinda is!”</td>

    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="nw">“O ciel!”</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Hands off; none of your impertinence, you vulgar,
low people!” says Betsinda, walking off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
her pan of coals. She heard the young gentlemen
playing at billiards as she went upstairs: first to
Prince Giglio’s bed, which she warmed, and then to
Prince Bulbo’s room.</p>

<p>He came in just as she had done; and as soon as
he saw her, “O! O! O! O! O! O! what a beyou—oo—ootiful
creature you are! You angel—you peri—you
rosebud, let me be thy bulbul—thy Bulbo, too!
Fly to the desert, fly with me! I never saw a
young gazelle to glad me with its dark blue eye that
had eyes like thine. Thou nymph of beauty, take,
take this young heart. A truer never did itself
sustain within a soldier’s waistcoat. Be mine! Be
mine! Be Princess of Crim Tartary! My Royal
father will approve our union; and, as for that little
carroty-haired Angelica, I do not care a fig for her
any more.”</p>

<p>“Go away, your Royal Highness, and go to bed,
please,” said Betsinda, with the warming-pan.</p>

<p>But Bulbo said, “No, never, till thou swearest
to be mine, thou lovely, blushing, chambermaid divine!
Here, at thy feet, the Royal Bulbo lies, the
trembling captive of Betsinda’s eyes.”</p>

<p>And he went on, making himself so <em>absurd and
ridiculous</em>, that Betsinda, who was full of fun, gave
him a touch with the warming-pan, which, I promise
you, made him cry “O-o-o-o!” in a very different
manner.</p>

<p>Prince Bulbo made such a noise that Prince Giglio,
who heard him from the next room, came in to
see what was the matter. As soon as he saw what
was taking place, Giglio, in a fury, rushed on
Bulbo, kicked him in the rudest manner up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
ceiling, and went on kicking him till his hair was
quite out of curl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/thackeray13.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="Betsinda hitting Bulbo with the warming-pan" />
</div>

<p>Poor Betsinda did not know whether to laugh or
to cry; and kicking certainly must hurt the Prince,
but then he looked so droll! When Giglio had done
knocking him up and down to the ground, and
whilst he went into a corner rubbing himself, what
do you think Giglio does? He goes down on his
own knees to Betsinda, takes her hand, begs her to
accept his heart, and offers to marry her that
moment.</p>

<p>Fancy Betsinda’s condition, who had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
love with the Prince ever since she first saw him
in the palace garden, when she was quite a little
child.</p>

<p>“Oh, divine Betsinda!” says the Prince, “how
have I lived fifteen years in thy company without
seeing thy perfections? What woman in all
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, nay, in Australia,
only it is not yet discovered, can presume to
be thy equal? Angelica? Pish! Gruffanuff? Phoo!
The Queen? Ha, ha! Thou art my Queen. Thou
art the real Angelica, because thou art really angelic.”</p>

<p>“O, Prince! I am but a poor chambermaid,” says
Betsinda, looking, however, very much pleased.</p>

<p>“Didst thou not tend me in my sickness, when all
forsook me?” continues Giglio. “Did not thy gentle
hand smooth my pillow, and bring me jelly and
roast chicken?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Prince, I did,” says Betsinda, “and I
sewed your Royal Highness’s shirt-buttons on too,
if you please, your Royal Highness,” cries this artless
maiden.</p>

<p>When poor Prince Bulbo, who was now madly in
love with Betsinda, heard this declaration, when he
saw the unmistakable glances which she flung upon
Giglio, Bulbo began to cry bitterly, and tore quantities
of hair out of his head, till it all covered the
room like so much tow.</p>

<p>Betsinda had left the warming-pan on the floor
while the Princes were going on with their conversation,
and as they began now to quarrel and be
very fierce with one another, she thought proper to
run away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>“You great big blubbering booby, tearing your
hair in the corner there; of course you will give me
satisfaction for insulting Betsinda. You dare to
kneel down at Princess Giglio’s knees and kiss her
hand!”</p>

<p>“She’s not Princess Giglio!” roars out Bulbo.
“She shall be Princess Bulbo, no other shall be
Princess Bulbo.”</p>

<p>“You are engaged to my cousin!” bellows out
Giglio.</p>

<p>“I hate your cousin,” says Bulbo.</p>

<p>“You shall give me satisfaction for insulting
her!” cries Giglio in a fury.</p>

<p>“I’ll have your life.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run you through.”</p>

<p>“I’ll cut your throat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll blow your brains out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll knock your head off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a friend to you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a bullet into you in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“We’ll meet again,” says Giglio, shaking his fist
in Bulbo’s face; and seizing up the warming-pan, he
kissed it, because, forsooth, Betsinda had carried it,
and rushed downstairs. What should he see on the
landing but His Majesty talking to Betsinda, whom
he called by all sorts of fond names. His Majesty
had heard a row in the building, so he stated, and
smelling something burning, had come out to see
what the matter was.</p>

<p>“It’s the young gentlemen smoking, perhaps,
sir,” says Betsinda.</p>

<p>“Charming chambermaid,” says the King (like
all the rest of them), “never mind the young men!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
Turn thy eyes on a middle-aged autocrat, who has
been considered not ill-looking in his time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! what will Her Majesty say?” cries Betsinda.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty!” laughs the monarch. “Her
Majesty be hanged. Am I not Autocrat of Paflagonia?
Have I not blocks, ropes, axes, hangmen—ha?
Runs not a river by my palace wall? Have I
not sacks to sew up wives withal? Say but the word,
that thou wilt be mine own—your mistress straightway
in a sack is sewn, and thou the sharer of my
heart and throne.”</p>

<p>When Giglio heard these atrocious sentiments, he
forgot the respect usually paid to Royalty, lifted
up the warming-pan, and knocked down the King
as flat as a pancake; after which, Master Giglio
took to his heels and ran away, and Betsinda went
off screaming, and the Queen, Gruffanuff, and the
Princess, all came out of their rooms. Fancy their
feelings on beholding their husband, father, sovereign,
in this posture!</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW KING VALOROSO WAS IN A DREADFUL PASSION</span></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray15.jpg" width="225" height="250" alt="The King (with a bent nose) handing a death-warrant to Hedzoff" />
</div>

<p>As soon as the coals began to burn him, the King
came to himself and stood up. “Ho! my captain
of the guards!” His Majesty exclaimed, stamping
his royal feet with rage. O piteous spectacle! the
King’s nose was bent quite crooked by the blow of
Prince Giglio! His Majesty ground his teeth with
rage. “Hedzoff,” he said, taking a death-warrant
out of his dressing-gown pocket, “Hedzoff, good
Hedzoff, seize upon the Prince. Thou’lt find him
in his chamber two pair up. But now he dared,
with sacrilegious hand, to strike the sacred night-cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
of a king—Hedzoff, and floor me with a warming-pan!
Away, no more demur, the villain dies!
See it be done, or else—h’m—ha!—h’m! mind thine
own eyes!” and followed by the ladies, and lifting
up the tails of his dressing-gown, the King entered
his own apartment.</p>

<p>Captain Hedzoff was very much affected, having
a sincere love for Giglio. “Poor, poor Giglio!” he
said, the tears rolling over his manly face, and dripping
down his moustachios; “my noble young
Prince, is it my hand must lead thee to death?”</p>

<p>“Lead him to fiddlestick, Hedzoff,” said a female
voice. It was Gruffanuff, who had come out in her
dressing-gown when she heard the noise. “The
King said you were to hang the Prince. Well, hang
the Prince.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” says Hedzoff, who
was not a very clever man.</p>

<p>“You Gaby! he didn’t say <em>which</em> Prince,” says
Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“No; he didn’t say which, certainly,” said Hedzoff.</p>

<p>“Well, then, take Bulbo, and hang <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>When Captain Hedzoff heard this, he began to
dance about for joy. “Obedience is a soldier’s
honor,” says he. “Prince Bulbo’s head will do
capitally,” and he went to arrest the Prince the very
first thing next morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/thackeray16.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="Hedzoff and Bulbo" />
</div>

<p>He knocked at the door. “Who’s there?” says
Bulbo. “Captain Hedzoff? Step in, pray, my
good Captain; I’m delighted to see you; I have
been expecting you.”</p>

<p>“Have you?” says Hedzoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sleibootz, my Chamberlain, will act for me,”
says the Prince.</p>

<p>“I beg your Royal Highness’s pardon, but you
will have to act for yourself, and it’s a pity to wake
Baron Sleibootz.”</p>

<p>The Prince Bulbo still seemed to take the matter
very coolly. “Of course, Captain,” says he, “you
are come about that affair with Prince Giglio?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” says Hedzoff, “that affair of Prince
Giglio.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it to be pistols, or swords, Captain?” asks
Bulbo. “I’m a mighty good hand with both, and I’ll
do for Prince Giglio as sure as my name is my
Royal Highness Prince Bulbo.”</p>

<p>“There’s some mistake, my Lord,” says the Captain.
“The business is done with <em>axes</em> among us.”</p>

<p>“Axes? That’s sharp work,” says Bulbo. “Call
my Chamberlain, he’ll he my second, and in ten
minutes, I flatter myself, you’ll see Master Giglio’s
head off his impertinent shoulders. I’m hungry
for his blood. Hoo-oo, aw!” and he looked as savage
as an ogre.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but by this warrant I
am to take you prisoner, and hand you over to—to
the executioner.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh, my good man!—Stop, I say—ho!—hulloa!”
was all that this luckless Prince was enabled
to say, for Hedzoff’s guards seizing him, tied
a handkerchief over his mouth and face, and carried
him to the place of execution.</p>

<p>The King, who happened to be talking to Glumboso,
saw him pass, and took a pinch of snuff and
said, “So much for Giglio. Now let’s go to breakfast.”</p>

<p>The Captain of the Guard handed over his prisoner
to the Sheriff, with the fatal order,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">At sight cut off the bearer’s head.</span></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Valoroso XXIV.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>“It’s a mistake,” says Bulbo, who did not seem
to understand the business in the least.</p>

<p>“Poo—poo—pooh,” says the Sheriff. “Fetch
Jack Ketch instantly. Jack Ketch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>And poor Bulbo was led to the scaffold, where
an executioner with a block and a tremendous axe
was always ready in case he should be wanted.</p>

<p>But we must now revert to Giglio and Betsinda.</p>

<h3 id="ch11">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT GRUFFANUFF DID TO GIGLIO AND BETSINDA</span></h3>

<p>Gruffanuff, who had seen what had happened
with the King, and knew that Giglio must come to
grief, got up very early the next morning, and went
to devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband,
as the silly old thing insisted on calling him.
She found him walking up and down the garden,
thinking of a rhyme for Betsinda (<em>tinder</em> and <em>winda</em>
were all he could find), and indeed having forgotten
all about the past evening, except that Betsinda
was the most lovely of beings.</p>

<p>“Well, dear Giglio,” says Gruff.</p>

<p>“Well, dear Gruffy,” says Giglio, only <em>he</em> was
quite satirical.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking, darling, what you must
do in this scrape. You must fly the country for a
while.”</p>

<p>“What scrape?—fly the country? Never without
her I love, Countess,” says Giglio.</p>

<p>“No, she will accompany you, dear Prince,” she
says, in her most coaxing accents. “First, we must
get the jewels belonging to our royal parents, and
those of her and his present Majesty. Here is the
key, duck; they are all yours, you know, by right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
for you are the rightful King of Paflagonia, and
your wife will be the rightful Queen.”</p>

<p>“Will she?” says Giglio.</p>

<p>“Yes; and having got the jewels, go to Glumboso’s
apartment, where, under his bed, you will
find sacks containing money to the amount of
£217,000,000,987,439 13s. 6½d., all belonging to
you, for he took it out of your royal father’s room
on the day of his death. With this we will fly.”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> will fly?” says Giglio.</p>

<p>“Yes, you and your bride—your affianced love—your
Gruffy!” says the Countess, with a languishing
leer.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> my bride!” says Giglio. “You, you hideous
old woman!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you—you wretch! didn’t you give me this
paper promising marriage?” cries Gruff.</p>

<p>“Get away, you old goose! I love Betsinda, and
Betsinda only!” And in a fit of terror he ran from
her as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>“He! he! he!” shrieks out Gruff; “a promise is a
promise if there are laws in Paflagonia! And as for
that monster, that wretch, that fiend, that ugly little
vixen—as for that upstart, that ingrate, that beast,
Betsinda, Master Giglio will have no little difficulty
in discovering her whereabouts. He may look very
long before finding <em>her</em>, I warrant. He little knows
that Miss Betsinda is—”</p>

<p>Is—what? Now, you shall hear. Poor Betsinda
got up at five in winter’s morning to bring her cruel
mistress her tea; and instead of finding her in a good
humor, found Gruffy as cross as two sticks. The
Countess boxed Betsinda’s ears half a dozen times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
whilst she was dressing; but as poor little Betsinda
was used to this kind of treatment, she did not feel
any special alarm. “And now,” says she, “when
Her Majesty rings her bell twice, I’ll trouble you,
miss, to attend.”</p>

<p>So when the Queen’s bell rang twice, Betsinda
came to Her Majesty and made a pretty little curtsey.
The Queen, the Princess, and Gruffanuff were
all three in the room. As soon as they saw her they
began.</p>

<p>“You wretch!” says the Queen.</p>

<p>“You little vulgar thing!” says the Princess.</p>

<p>“You beast!” says Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“Get out of my sight!” says the Queen.</p>

<p>“Go away with you, do!” says the Princess.</p>

<p>“Quit the premises!” says Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>Alas! and woe is me! very lamentable events had
occurred to Betsinda that morning, and all in consequence
of that fatal warming-pan business of the
previous night. The King had offered to marry
her; of course Her Majesty the Queen was jealous;
Bulbo had fallen in love with her; of course Angelica
was furious: Giglio was in love with her, and
oh, what a fury Gruffy was in!</p>

<p>“Give her the rags she wore when she came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the house and turn her out of it!” cries the Queen.
“Mind she does not go with <em>my</em> shoes on, which
I lent her so kindly,” says the Princess; and indeed
the Princess’s shoes were a great deal too big for
Betsinda.</p>

<p>“Come with me, you filthy hussy!” and taking up
the Queen’s poker, the cruel Gruffanuff drove Betsinda
into her room.</p>

<p>The Countess went to the glass box in which she
had kept Betsinda’s old cloak and shoe this ever so
long, and said, “Take those rags, you little beggar
creature, and strip off everything belonging to honest
people, and go about your business”; and she
actually tore off the poor little delicate thing’s back
almost all her things, and told her to be off out of
the house.</p>

<p>Poor Betsinda huddled the cloak round her back,
on which were embroidered the letters <span class="smcapuc">PRIN…
ROSAL…</span> and then came a great rent.</p>

<p>As for the shoe, what was she to do with one poor
little tootsey sandal? the string was still to it, so she
hung it round her neck.</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me a pair of shoes to go out in
the snow, mum, if you please, mum?” cried the poor
child.</p>

<p>“No, you wicked beast!” says Gruffanuff, driving
her along with the poker—driving her down the
cold stairs—driving her through the cold hall—flinging
her out into the cold street, so that the
knocker itself shed tears to see her!</p>

<p>But a kind fairy made the soft snow warm for her
little feet, and she wrapped herself up in the ermine
of her mantle, and was gone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now let us think about breakfast,” says
the greedy Queen.</p>

<p>“What dress shall I put on, mamma? the pink or
the pea-green?” says Angelica. “Which do you
think the dear Prince will like best?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. V.!” sings out the King from his dressing-room,
“let us have sausages for breakfast! Remember
we have Prince Bulbo staying with us!”</p>

<p>And they all went to get ready.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock came, and they were all in the breakfast-room,
and no Prince Bulbo as yet. The urn
was hissing and humming: the muffins were smoking—such
a heap of muffins! the eggs were done,
there was a pot of raspberry jam, and coffee, and
a beautiful chicken and tongue on the side-table.
Marmitonio the cook brought in the sausages. Oh,
how nice they smelt!</p>

<p>“Where is Bulbo?” said the King. “John, where
is His Royal Highness?”</p>

<p>John said he had a took hup His Roilighnessesses
shaving-water, and his clothes and things, and he
wasn’t in his room, which he sposed His Royliness
was just stepped hout.</p>

<p>“Stepped out before breakfast in the snow! Impossible!”
says the King, sticking his fork into a
sausage. “My dear, take one. Angelica, won’t
you have a saveloy?”</p>

<p>The Princess took one, being very fond of
them; and at this moment Glumboso entered
with Captain Hedzoff, both looking very much
disturbed.</p>

<p>“I am afraid your Majesty—” cries Glumboso.</p>

<p>“No business before breakfast, Glum!” says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
King. “Breakfast first, business next. Mrs. V.,
some more sugar!”</p>

<p>“Sire, I am afraid if we wait till after breakfast
it will be too late,” says Glumboso. “He—he—he’ll
be hanged at half-past nine.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about hanging and spoil my breakfast,
you unkind vulgar man you,” cries the Princess.
“John, some mustard. Pray who is to be
hanged?”</p>

<p>“Sire, it is the Prince,” whispers Glumboso to
the King.</p>

<p>“Talk about business after breakfast, I tell you!”
says His Majesty, quite sulky.</p>

<p>“We shall have a war, Sire, depend on it,” says
the Minister. “His father, King Padella.…”</p>

<p>“His father, King <em>who</em>?” says the King. “King
Padella is not Giglio’s father. My brother, King
Savio, was Giglio’s father.”</p>

<p>“It’s Prince Bulbo they are hanging, Sire, not
Prince Giglio,” says the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>“You told me to hang the Prince, and I took the
ugly one,” says Hedzoff. “I didn’t, of course, think
Your Majesty intended to murder your own flesh
and blood!”</p>

<p>The King for all reply flung the plate of sausages
at Hedzoff’s head. The Princess cried out
“Hee-karee-karee!” and fell down in a fainting fit.</p>

<p>“Turn the cock of the urn upon Her Royal Highness,”
said the King, and the boiling water gradually
revived her. His Majesty looked at his watch,
compared it by the clock in the parlor, and by that
of the church in the square opposite; then he wound
it up; then he looked at it again. “The great question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
is,” says he, “am I fast or am I slow? If I’m
slow, we may as well go on with breakfast. If I’m
fast, why, there is just the possibility of saving
Prince Bulbo. It’s a doosid awkward mistake, and
upon my word, Hedzoff, I have the greatest mind
to have you hanged too.”</p>

<p>“Sire, I did but my duty; a soldier has but his
orders. I didn’t expect after forty-seven years of
faithful service that my sovereign would think of
putting me to a felon’s death!”</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand plagues upon you! Can’t
you see that while you are talking my Bulbo is being
hung?” screamed the Princess.</p>

<p>“By Jove! she’s always right, that girl, and I’m
so absent,” says the King, looking at his watch
again. “Ha! there go the drums! What a doosid
awkward thing though!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, you goose! Write the reprieve, and
let me run with it,” cries the Princess—and she got
a sheet of paper, and pen and ink, and laid them
before the King.</p>

<p>“Confound it! where are my spectacles?” the
Monarch exclaimed. “Angelica! go up into my
bedroom, look under my pillow, not your mamma’s;
there you’ll see my keys. Bring them down
to me, and—Well, well! what impetuous things
these girls are!” Angelica was gone, and had run
up panting to the bedroom, and found the keys,
and was back again before the King had finished
a muffin. “Now, love,” says he, “you must go all
the way back for my desk, in which my spectacles
are. If you would but have heard me out.… Be
hanged to her! There she is off again. Angelica!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Angelica!</span>” When His Majesty called in his <em>loud</em>
voice, she knew she must obey, and came back.</p>

<p>“My dear, when you go out of a room, how often
have I told you, <em>shut the door</em>. That’s a darling.
That’s all.” At last the keys and the desk and the
spectacles were got, and the King mended his pen,
and signed his name to a reprieve, and Angelica ran
with it as swift as the wind. “You’d better stay, my
love, and finish the muffins. There’s no use going.
Be sure it’s too late. Hand me over that raspberry
jam, please,” said the Monarch. “Bong! Bawong!
There goes the half-hour. I knew it was.”</p>

<p>Angelica ran, and ran, and ran, and ran. She
ran up Fore Street, and down High Street, and
through the Market-place, and down to the left, and
over the bridge, and up the blind alley, and back
again, and round by the Castle, and so along by
the Haberdasher’s on the right, opposite the lamppost,
and round the square, and she came—she came
to the <em>Execution place</em>, where she saw Bulbo laying
his head on the block!!! The executioner raised
his axe, but at that moment the Princess came
panting up and cried “Reprieve!” “Reprieve!”
screamed the Princess. “Reprieve!” shouted all
the people. Up the scaffold stairs she sprang, with
the agility of a lighter of lamps; and flinging herself
in Bulbo’s arms, regardless of all ceremony,
she cried out, “Oh, my Prince! my lord! my love!
my Bulbo! Thine Angelica has been in time to
save thy precious existence, sweet rosebud; to prevent
thy being nipped in thy young bloom! Had
aught befallen thee, Angelica too had died, and
welcomed death that joined her to her Bulbo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>“H’m! there’s no accounting for tastes,” said
Bulbo, looking so very much puzzled and uncomfortable
that the Princess, in tones of tenderest
strain, asked the cause of his disquiet.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Angelica,” said he, “since
I came here yesterday, there has been such a row,
and disturbance, and quarrelling, and fighting, and
chopping of heads off, and the deuce to pay, that
I am inclined to go back to Crim Tartary.”</p>

<p>“But with me as thy bride, my Bulbo! Though
wherever thou art is Crim Tartary to me, my bold,
my beautiful, my Bulbo!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I suppose we must be married,” says
Bulbo. “Doctor, you came to read the Funeral
Service—read the Marriage Service, will you?
What must be, must. That will satisfy Angelica,
and then, in the name of peace and quietness, do let
us go back to breakfast.”</p>

<p>Bulbo had carried a rose in his mouth all the time
of the dismal ceremony. It was a fairy rose, and
he was told by his mother that he ought never to
part with it. So he had kept it between his teeth,
even when he laid his poor head upon the block,
hoping vaguely that some chance would turn up in
his favor. As he began to speak to Angelica, he
forgot about the rose, and of course it dropped
out of his mouth. The romantic Princess instantly
stooped and seized it. “Sweet rose!” she exclaimed,
“that bloomed upon my Bulbo’s lip, never, never
will I part from thee!” and she placed it in her
bosom. And you know Bulbo <em>couldn’t</em> ask her to
give the rose back again. And they went to breakfast;
and as they walked, it appeared to Bulbo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
that Angelica became more exquisitely lovely every
moment.</p>

<p>He was frantic until they were married; and
now, strange to say, it was Angelica who didn’t
care about him! He knelt down, he kissed her hand,
he prayed and begged; he cried with admiration;
while she for her part said she really thought they
might wait; it seemed to her he was not handsome
any more—no, not at all, quite the reverse; and not
clever, no, very stupid; and not well bred, like
Giglio; no, on the contrary, dreadfully vul—</p>

<p>What, I cannot say, for King Valoroso roared
out “<em>Pooh</em>, stuff!” in a terrible voice. “We will
have no more of this shilly-shallying! Call the
Archbishop, and let the Prince and Princess be
married offhand!”</p>

<p>So, married they were, and I am sure for my
part I trust they will be happy.</p>

<h3 id="ch12">XII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW BETSINDA FLED, AND WHAT BECAME OF HER</span></h3>

<p>Betsinda wandered on and on, till she passed
through the town gates, and so on the great Crim
Tartary road, the very way on which Giglio too was
going. “Ah!” thought she, as the diligence passed
her, of which the conductor was blowing a delightful
tune on his horn, “how I should like to be on
that coach!” But the coach and the jingling horses
were very soon gone. She little knew who was in
it, though very likely she was thinking of him all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
the time. Then came an empty cart, returning
from market; and the driver being a kind man, and
seeing such a very pretty girl trudging along the
road with bare feet, most good-naturedly gave her a
seat. He said he lived on the confines of the forest,
where his old father was a woodman, and, if she
liked, he would take her so far on her road. All
roads were the same to little Betsinda, so she very
thankfully took this one.</p>

<p>And the carter put a cloth round her bare feet,
and gave her some bread and cold bacon, and was
very kind to her. For all that she was very cold
and melancholy. When after travelling on and on,
evening came, and all the black pines were bending
with snow, and there, at last, was the comfortable
light beaming in the woodman’s windows; and so
they arrived, and went into his cottage. He was
an old man, and had a number of children, who were
just at supper, with nice hot bread-and-milk, when
their elder brother arrived with the cart. And they
jumped and clapped their hands; for they were
good children; and he had brought them toys from
the town. And when they saw the pretty stranger,
they ran to her, and brought her to the fire, and
rubbed her poor little feet, and brought her bread-and-milk.</p>

<p>“Look, father!” they said to the old woodman,
“look at this poor girl, and see what pretty cold
feet she has. They are as white as our milk! And
look and see what an odd cloak she has, just like
the bit of velvet that hangs up in our cupboard, and
which you found that day the little cubs were killed
by King Padella, in the forest! And look, why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
bless us all! she has got round her neck just such
another little shoe as that you brought home, and
have shown us so often—a little blue velvet shoe!”</p>

<p>“What,” said the old woodman, “what is all this
about a shoe and a cloak?”</p>

<p>And Betsinda explained that she had been left,
when quite a little child, at the town with this cloak
and this shoe. And the persons who had taken care
of her had—had been angry with her, for no fault,
she hoped, of her own. And they sent her away
with her old clothes—and here, in fact, she was.
She remembered having been in a forest—and perhaps
it was a dream—it was so very odd and strange—having
lived in a cave with lions there; and, before
that, having lived in a very, very fine house,
as fine as the King’s, in the town.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray17.jpg" width="225" height="225" alt="A five-shilling piece" />
</div>

<p>When the woodman heard this, he was so astonished,
it was quite curious to see how astonished
he was. He went to his cupboard,
and took out of a stocking
a five-shilling piece of King
Cavolfiore, and vowed it was
exactly like the young woman.
And then he produced the shoe
and piece of velvet which he
had kept so long, and compared
them with the things which Betsinda
wore. In Betsinda’s little
shoe was written, “Hopkins, maker to the Royal
Family”; so in the other shoe was written, “Hopkins,
maker to the Royal Family.” In the inside
of Betsinda’s piece of cloak was embroidered, “Prin
Rosal”; in the other piece of cloak was embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
“cess Ba. No. 246.” So that when put
together you read, “Princess Rosalba. No. 246.”</p>

<p>On seeing this, the dear old woodman fell down
on his knee, saying, “O my Princess, O my gracious
royal lady, O my rightful Queen of Crim Tartary,—I
hail thee—I acknowledge thee—I do thee homage!”
And in token of his fealty, he rubbed his
venerable nose three times on the ground, and put
the Princess’s foot on his head.</p>

<p>“Why,” said she, “my good woodman, you must
be a nobleman of my royal father’s Court!” For
in her lowly retreat, and under the name of Betsinda,
Her Majesty, Rosalba, Queen of Crim Tartary,
had read of the customs of all foreign courts
and nations.</p>

<p>“Marry, indeed, am I, my gracious liege—the
poor Lord Spinachi once—the humble woodman
these fifteen years syne. Ever since the tyrant Padella
(may ruin overtake the treacherous knave!)
dismissed me from my post of First Lord.”</p>

<p>“First Lord of the Toothpick and Joint Keeper
of the Snuffbox? I mind me! Thou heldest these
posts under our royal Sire. They are restored to
thee, Lord Spinachi! I make thee knight of the
second class of our Order of the Pumpkin (the first
class being reserved for crowned heads alone).
Rise, Marquis of Spinachi!” And with indescribable
majesty, the Queen, who had no sword handy,
waved the pewter spoon with which she had been
taking her bread-and-milk, over the bald head of
the old nobleman, whose tears absolutely made a
puddle on the ground, and whose dear children
went to bed that night Lords and Ladies Bartolomeo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Ubaldo, Catarina, and Ottavia degli
Spinachi!</p>

<p>The acquaintance Her Majesty showed with the
history, and <em>noble families</em> of her empire, was wonderful.
“The House of Broccoli should remain
faithful to us,” she said; “they were ever welcome
at our Court. Have the Articiocchi, as was their
wont, turned to the Rising Sun? The family of
Sauerkraut must sure be with us—they were ever
welcome in the halls of King Cavolfiore.” And
so she went on enumerating quite a list of the
nobility and gentry of Crim Tartary, so admirably
had Her Majesty profited by her studies while in
exile.</p>

<p>The old Marquis of Spinachi said he could
answer for them all; that the whole country groaned
under Padella’s tyranny, and longed to return to
its rightful sovereign; and late as it was, he sent his
children, who knew the forest well, to summon this
nobleman and that; and when his eldest son, who
had been rubbing the horse down and giving him
his supper, came into the house for his own, the
Marquis told him to put his boots on, and a saddle
on the mare, and ride hither and thither to such
and such people.</p>

<p>When the young man heard who his companion
in the cart had been, he too knelt down and put her
royal foot on his head; he too bedewed the ground
with his tears; he was frantically in love with her,
as everybody now was who saw her; so were the
young Lords Bartolomeo and Ubaldo, who punched
each other’s little heads out of jealousy; and so,
when they came from east and west at the summons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
of the Marquis degli Spinachi, were the Crim Tartar
Lords who still remained faithful to the House
of Cavolfiore. They were such very old gentlemen
for the most part that Her Majesty never suspected
their absurd passion, and went among them
quite unaware of the havoc her beauty was causing,
until an old blind Lord who had joined her party
told her what the truth was; after which, for fear
of making the people too much in love with her, she
always wore a veil. She went about privately,
from one nobleman’s castle to another; and they
visited among themselves again, and had meetings,
and composed proclamations and counter-proclamations,
and distributed all the best places of the
kingdom amongst one another, and selected who of
the opposition party should be executed when the
Queen came to her own. And so in about a year
they were ready to move.</p>

<p>The party of Fidelity was in truth composed of
very feeble old fogies for the most part; they went
about the country waving their old swords and
flags, and calling “God save the Queen!” and King
Padella happening to be absent upon an invasion,
they had their own way for a little, and to be sure
the people were very enthusiastic whenever they
saw the Queen; otherwise the vulgar took matters
very quietly, for they said, as far as they could
recollect, they were pretty well as much taxed in
Cavolfiore’s time, as now in Padella’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="ch13">XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW QUEEN ROSALBA CAME TO THE CASTLE OF THE
BOLD COUNT HOGGINARMO</span></h3>

<p>Her Majesty, having indeed nothing else to
give, made all her followers Knights of the Pumpkin,
and Marquises, Earls, and Baronets; and they
had a little court for her, and made her a little
crown of gilt paper, and a robe of cotton velvet;
and they quarrelled about the places to be given
away in her court, and about rank and precedence
and dignities—you can’t think how they quarrelled!
The poor Queen was very tired of her
honors before she had had them a month, and I
dare say sighed sometimes even to be a lady’s-maid
again. But we must all do our duty in our respective
stations, so the Queen resigned herself to
perform hers.</p>

<p>We have said how it happened that none of the
Usurper’s troops came out to oppose this Army
of Fidelity; it pottered along as nimbly as the
gout of the principal commanders allowed: it consisted
of twice as many officers as soldiers: and at
length passed near the estates of one of the most
powerful noblemen of the country, who had not
declared for the Queen, but of whom her party had
hopes, as he was always quarrelling with King
Padella.</p>

<p>When they came close to his park gates, this
nobleman sent to say he would wait upon Her
Majesty: he was a most powerful warrior, and his
name was Count Hogginarmo, whose helmet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
took two strong negroes to carry. He knelt down
before her and said, “Madam and liege lady! it
becomes the great nobles of the Crimean realm to
show every outward sign of respect to the wearer
of the Crown, whoever that may be. We testify
to our own nobility in acknowledging yours. The
bold Hogginarmo bends the knee to the first of the
aristocracy of his country.”</p>

<p>Rosalba said, “The bold Count of Hogginarmo
was uncommonly kind.” But she felt afraid of
him, even while he was kneeling, and his eyes
scowled at her from between his whiskers, which
grew up to them.</p>

<p>“The first Count of the Empire, madam,” he
went on, “salutes the Sovereign. The Prince addresses
himself to the not more noble lady! Madam,
my hand is free, and I offer it, and my heart and
my sword to your service! My three wives lie
buried in my ancestral vaults. The third perished
but a year since; and this heart pines for a consort!
Deign to be mine, and I swear to bring to your
bridal table the head of King Padella, the eyes
and nose of his son Prince Bulbo, the right hand
and ears of the usurping Sovereign of Paflagonia,
which country shall thenceforth be an appanage to
your—to <em>our</em> Crown! Say yes; Hogginarmo is not
accustomed to be denied. Indeed I cannot contemplate
the possibility of a refusal: for frightful
will be the result; dreadful the murders; furious
the devastations; horrible the tyranny; tremendous
the tortures, misery, taxation, which the people
of this realm will endure, if Hogginarmo’s wrath
be aroused! I see consent in your Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
lovely eyes—their glances fill my soul with
rapture!”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” Rosalba said, withdrawing her hand
in great fright. “Your Lordship is exceedingly
kind; but I am sorry to tell you that I have a prior
attachment to a young gentleman by the name of—Prince—Giglio—and
never—never can marry
any one but him.”</p>

<p>Who can describe Hogginarmo’s wrath at this
remark? Rising up from the ground, he ground
his teeth so that fire flashed out of his mouth, from
which at the same time issued remarks and language,
so <em>loud, violent, and improper</em>, that this pen
shall never repeat them! “R-r-r-r-r-r—Rejected!
Fiends and perdition! The bold Hogginarmo rejected!
All the world shall hear of my rage; and
you, madam, you above all shall rue it!” And kicking
the two negroes before him, he rushed away,
his whiskers streaming in the wind.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray18.jpg" width="225" height="225" alt="Hogginarmo kicking two people that we
do not refer to as negroes in this day and age" />
</div>

<p>Her Majesty’s Privy Council was in a dreadful
panic when they saw Hogginarmo issue from the
royal presence in such a towering rage, making
footballs of the poor negroes—a panic which the
events justified. They marched off from Hogginarmo’s
park very crestfallen; and in another half-hour
they were met by that rapacious chieftain
with a few of his followers, who cut, slashed,
charged, whacked, banged, and pommelled amongst
them, took the Queen prisoner, and drove the
Army of Fidelity to I don’t know where.</p>

<p>Poor Queen! Hogginarmo, her conqueror, would
not condescend to see her. “Get a horse-van!” he
said to his grooms, “clap the hussy into it, and send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
her, with my compliments, to His Majesty King
Padella.”</p>

<p>Along with his lovely prisoner, Hogginarmo
sent a letter full of servile compliments and loathsome
flatteries to King Padella, for whose life, and
that of his royal family, the <em>hypocritical humbug</em>
pretended to offer the most fulsome prayers. And
Hogginarmo
promised speedily
to pay his humble
homage at his august
master’s
throne, of which
he begged leave to
be counted the
most loyal and
constant defender.
Such a <em>wary</em> old
<em>bird</em> as King Padella
was not to
be caught by Master
Hogginarmo’s
<em>chaff</em>, and we shall hear presently how the tyrant
treated his upstart vassal. No, no; depend on’t,
two such rogues do not trust one another.</p>

<p>So this poor Queen was laid in the straw like
Margery Daw, and driven along in the dark ever
so many miles to the Court, where King Padella
had now arrived, having vanquished all his enemies,
murdered most of them, and brought some of the
richest into captivity with him for the purpose of
torturing them and finding out where they had hidden
their money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosalba heard their shrieks and groans in the
dungeon in which she was thrust; a most awful
black hole, full of bats, rats, mice, toads, frogs, mosquitoes,
bugs, fleas, serpents, and every kind of
horror. No light was let into it, otherwise the gaolers
might have seen her and fallen in love with
her, as an owl that lived up in the roof of the tower
did, and a cat, you know, who can see in the dark,
and having set its green eyes on Rosalba, never
would be got to go back to the turnkey’s wife to
whom it belonged. And the toads in the dungeon
came and kissed her feet, and the vipers wound
round her neck and arms, and never hurt her, so
charming was this poor Princess in the midst of her
misfortunes.</p>

<p>At last, after she had been kept in this place <em>ever
so long</em>, the door of the dungeon opened, and the
terrible King Padella came in.</p>

<p>But what he said and did must be reserved for
another chapter, as we must now go back to Prince
Giglio.</p>

<h3 id="ch14">XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT BECAME OF GIGLIO</span></h3>

<p>The idea of marrying such an old creature as
Gruffanuff frightened Prince Giglio so, that he
ran up to his room, packed his trunks, fetched in a
couple of porters, and was off to the diligence
office in a twinkling.</p>

<p>It was well that he was so quick in his operations,
did not dawdle over his luggage, and took the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
coach, for as soon as the mistake about Prince Bulbo
was found out, that cruel Glumboso sent up a
couple of policemen to Prince Giglio’s room, with
orders that he should be carried to Newgate, and
his head taken off before twelve o’clock. But the
coach was out of the Paflagonian dominions before
two o’clock; and I dare say the express that was
sent after Prince Giglio did not ride very quick,
for many people in Paflagonia had a regard for
Giglio, as the son of their old sovereign; a Prince
who, with all his weaknesses, was very much better
than his brother, the usurping, lazy, careless, passionate,
tyrannical, reigning monarch. That Prince
busied himself with the balls, fêtes, masquerades,
hunting-parties, and so forth, which he thought
proper to give on the occasion of his daughter’s
marriage to Prince Bulbo; and let us trust was
not sorry in his own heart that his brother’s son
had escaped the scaffold.</p>

<p>It was very cold weather, and the snow was on
the ground, and Giglio, who gave his name as simple
Mr. Giles, was very glad to get a comfortable
place in the coupé of the diligence, where he sat
with the conductor and another gentleman. At
the first stage from Blombodinga, as they stopped
to change horses, there came up to the diligence a
very ordinary, vulgar-looking woman, with a bag
under her arm, who asked for a place. All the inside
places were taken, and the young woman was
informed that if she wished to travel, she must go
upon the roof; and the passenger inside with Giglio
(a rude person, I should think), put his head out
of the window, and said, “Nice weather for travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
outside! I wish you a pleasant journey, my
dear.” The poor woman coughed very much, and
Giglio pitied her. “I will give up my place to her,”
says he, “rather than she should travel in the cold
air with that horrid cough.” On which the vulgar
traveller said, “<em>You’d</em> keep her warm, I am sure, if
it’s a <em>muff</em> she wants.” On which Giglio pulled his
nose, boxed his ears, hit him in the eye, and gave
this vulgar person a warning never to call him
<em>muff</em> again.</p>

<p>Then he sprang up gaily on to the roof of the
diligence, and made himself very comfortable in
the straw. The vulgar traveller got down only at
the next station, and Giglio took his place again,
and talked to the person next to him. She appeared
to be a most agreeable, well-informed, and entertaining
female. They travelled together till night,
and she gave Giglio all sorts of things out of the
bag which she carried, and which indeed seemed
to contain the most wonderful collection of articles.
He was thirsty—out there came a pint bottle of
Bass’s pale ale, and a silver mug! Hungry—she
took out a cold fowl, some slices of ham, bread, salt,
and a most delicious piece of cold plum-pudding,
and a little glass of brandy afterwards.</p>

<p>As they travelled, this plain-looking, queer
woman talked to Giglio on a variety of subjects,
in which the poor Prince showed his ignorance as
much as she did her capacity. He owned, with
many blushes, how ignorant he was; on which the
lady said, “My dear Gigl—my good Mr. Giles,
you are a young man, and have plenty of time before
you. You have nothing to do but to improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
yourself. Who knows but that you may find use
for your knowledge some day? When—when you
may be wanted at home, as some people may be.”
“Good heavens, madam!” says he, “do you know
me?”</p>

<p>“I know a number of funny things,” says the
lady, “I have been at some people’s christenings,
and turned away from other folks’ doors. I have
seen some people spoilt by good fortune, and others,
as I hope, improved by hardship. I advise you to
stay at the town where the coach stops for the night.
Stay there and study, and remember your old
friend to whom you were kind.”</p>

<p>“And who is my old friend?” asked Giglio.
“When you want anything,” says the lady, “look
in this bag, which I leave to you as a present, and
be grateful to—”</p>

<p>“To whom, madam?” says he.</p>

<p>“To the Fairy Blackstick,” says the lady, flying
out of the window. And when Giglio asked the
conductor if he knew where the lady was?</p>

<p>“What lady?” says the man; “there has been no
lady in this coach, except the old woman, who got
out at the last stage.” And Giglio thought he had
been dreaming. But there was the bag which
Blackstick had given him lying on his lap; and
when he came to the town he took it in his hand and
went into the inn.</p>

<p>They gave him a very bad bedroom, and Giglio,
when he woke in the morning, fancying himself in
the Royal Palace at home, called, “John, Charles,
Thomas! My chocolate—my dressing-gown—my
slippers”; but nobody came. There was no bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
so he went and bawled out for waiter on the top
of the stairs.</p>

<p>The landlady came up, looking—looking like
this—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/thackeray19.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="The landlady" />
</div>

<p>“What are you a hollaring and a bellaring for
here, young man?” says she.</p>

<p>“There’s no warm water—no servants; my boots
are not even cleaned.”</p>

<p>“He, he! Clean ’em yourself,” says the landlady.
“You young students give yourselves pretty airs.
I never heard such impudence.”</p>

<p>“I’ll quit the house this instant,” says Giglio.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better, young man. Pay your
bill and be off. All my rooms is wanted for gentlefolks,
and not for such as you.”</p>

<p>“You may well keep the Bear Inn,” said Giglio.
“You should have yourself painted as the sign.”</p>

<p>The landlady of the Bear went away <em>growling</em>.
And Giglio returned to his room, where the first
thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
which seemed to give a little hop as he came in.
“I hope it has some breakfast in it,” says Giglio,
“for I have only a very little money left.” But on
opening the bag, what do you think was there? A
blacking-brush and a pot of Warren’s jet, and on
the pot was written—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Poor young men their boots must black:</div>
<div class="verse">Use me and cork me and put me back.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So Giglio laughed and blacked his boots, and put
back the brush and the bottle into the bag.</p>

<p>When he had done dressing himself, the bag gave
another little hop, and he went to it and took out—</p>

<p>1. A tablecloth and a napkin.</p>

<p>2. A sugar-basin full of the best loaf-sugar.</p>

<p>4, 6, 8, 10. Two forks, two teaspoons, two knives,
and a pair of sugar-tongs, and a butter-knife, all
marked G.</p>

<p>11, 12, 13. A teacup, saucer, and slop-basin.</p>

<p>14. A jug full of delicious cream.</p>

<p>15. A canister with black tea and green.</p>

<p>16. A large tea-urn and boiling water.</p>

<p>17. A saucepan, containing three eggs nicely
done.</p>

<p>18. A quarter of a pound of best Epping butter.</p>

<p>19. A brown loaf.</p>

<p>And if he hadn’t enough now for a good breakfast,
I should like to know who ever had one?</p>

<p>Giglio, having had his breakfast, popped all the
things back into the bag, and went out looking for
lodgings. I forgot to say that this celebrated university
town was called Bosforo.</p>

<p>He took a modest lodging opposite the Schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
paid his bill at the inn, and went to his apartment
with his trunk, carpet-bag, and not forgetting, we
may be sure, his <em>other</em> bag.</p>

<p>When he opened his trunk, which the day before
he had filled with his best clothes, he found it
contained only books. And in the first of them
which he opened there was written—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Clothes for the back, books for the head:</div>
<div class="verse">Read and remember them when they are read.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in his bag, when Giglio looked in it, he found
a student’s cap and gown, a writing-book full of
paper, an inkstand, pens, and a Johnson’s dictionary,
which was very useful to him, as his spelling
had been sadly neglected.</p>

<p>So he sat down and worked away, very, very
hard for a whole year, during which “Mr. Giles”
was quite an example to all the students in the
University of Bosforo. He never got into any riots
or disturbances. The Professors all spoke well of
him, and the students liked him too; so that, when
at examination, he took all the prizes, viz.—</p>

<ul>
<li>The Spelling Prize</li>
<li>The Writing Prize</li>
<li>The History Prize</li>
<li>The Catechism Prize</li>
<li>The French Prize</li>
<li>The Arithmetic Prize</li>
<li>The Latin Prize</li>
<li>The Good Conduct Prize,</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">all his fellow-students said, “Hurray! Hurray for
Giles! Giles is the boy—the student’s joy! Hurray
for Giles!” And he brought quite a quantity of
medals, crowns, books, and tokens of distinction
home to his lodgings.</p>

<p>One day after the Examinations, as he was diverting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
himself at a coffee-house with two friends—(Did
I tell you that in his bag, every Saturday
night, he found just enough to pay his bills, with a
guinea over, for pocket-money? Didn’t I tell you?
Well, he did, as sure as twice twenty makes forty-five)—he
chanced to look in the <cite>Bosforo Chronicle</cite>,
and read off, quite easily (for he could spell, read,
and write the longest words now), the following;—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Romantic Circumstance.</span>—One of the most
extraordinary adventures that we have ever heard
has set the neighboring country of Crim Tartary
in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>“It will be remembered that when the present
revered sovereign of Crim Tartary, His Majesty
King <em>Padella</em>, took possession of the throne, after
having vanquished, in the terrific battle of Blunderbusco,
the late King <em>Cavolfiore</em>, that Prince’s only
child, the Princess Rosalba, was not found in the
royal palace, of which King Padella took possession,
and, it was said, had strayed into the forest
(being abandoned by all her attendants), where
she had been eaten up by those ferocious lions, the
last pair of which were captured some time since,
and brought to the Tower, after killing several
hundred persons.</p>

<p>“His Majesty King Padella, who has the kindest
heart in the world, was grieved at the accident which
had occurred to the harmless little Princess, for
whom His Majesty’s known benevolence would
certainly have provided a fitting establishment.
But her death seemed to be certain. The mangled
remains of a cloak, and a little shoe, were found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the forest, during a hunting-party, in which the
intrepid sovereign of Crim Tartary slew two of
the lion’s cubs with his own spear. And these interesting
relics of an innocent little creature were
carried home and kept by their finder, the Baron
Spinachi, formerly an officer in Cavolfiore’s household.
The Baron was disgraced in consequence of
his known legitimist opinions, and has lived for
some time in the humble capacity of a woodcutter,
in a forest on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Crim
Tartary.</p>

<p>“Last Tuesday week Baron Spinachi and a number
of gentlemen, attached to the former dynasty,
appeared in arms, crying, ‘God save Rosalba, the
first Queen of Crim Tartary!’ and surrounding a
lady whom report describes as ‘<em>beautiful exceedingly</em>.’
Her history <em>may</em> be authentic, is certainly
most romantic.</p>

<p>“The personage calling herself Rosalba states
that she was brought out of the forest, fifteen years
since, by a lady in a car drawn by dragons (this
account is certainly <em>improbable</em>), that she was left
in the Palace Garden of Blombodinga, where Her
Royal Highness the Princess Angelica, now married
to His Royal Highness Bulbo, Crown Prince
of Crim Tartary, found the child, and, with <em>that
elegant benevolence</em> which has always distinguished
the heiress of the throne of Paflagonia, gave the
little outcast a <em>shelter and a home</em>! Her parentage
not being known, and her garb very humble, the
foundling was educated in the Palace in a menial
capacity, under the name of <em>Betsinda</em>.</p>

<p>“She did not give satisfaction, and was dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
carrying with her, certainly, part of a mantle and a
shoe, which she had on when first found. According
to her statement she quitted Blombodinga about
a year ago, since which time she has been with the
Spinachi family. On the very same morning the
Prince Giglio, nephew to the King of Paflagonia,
a young Prince whose character for <em>talent</em> and
<em>order</em> were, to say truth, <em>none of the highest</em>, also
quitted Blombodinga, and has not been since heard
of!”</p>

</div>

<p>“What an extraordinary story!” said Smith and
Jones, two young students, Giglio’s especial
friends.</p>

<p>“Ha! what is this?” Giglio went on, reading—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Second Edition, Express.</span>—We hear that the
troop under Baron Spinachi has been surrounded,
and utterly routed, by General Hogginarmo, and
the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> Princess is sent a prisoner to the
capital.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">University News.</span>—Yesterday, at the Schools,
the distinguished young student, Mr. Giles, read
a Latin oration, and was complimented by the
Chancellor of Bosforo, Dr. Prugnaro, with the
highest University honor—the wooden spoon.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Never mind that stuff,” says Giles, greatly disturbed.
“Come home with me, my friends. Gallant
Smith! intrepid Jones! friends of my studies—partakers
of my academic toils—I have that to
tell shall astonish your honest minds.”</p>

<p>“Go it, old boy!” cried the impetuous Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>“Talk away, my buck!” says Jones, a lively
fellow.</p>

<p>With an air of indescribable dignity, Giglio
checked their natural, but no more seemly, familiarity.
“Jones, Smith, my good friends,” said the
Prince, “disguise is henceforth useless; I am no
more the humble student Giles, I am the descendant
of a royal line.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Atavis edite regibus</i>, I know, old co—,” cried
Jones. He was going to say old cock, but a flash
from <span class="smcapuc">THE ROYAL EYE</span> again awed him.</p>

<p>“Friends,” continued the Prince, “I am that
Giglio, I am, in fact, Paflagonia. Rise, Smith,
and kneel not in the public street. Jones, thou
true heart! My faithless uncle, when I was a baby
filched from me that brave crown my father left
me, bred me, all young and careless of my rights,
like unto hapless Hamlet, Prince of Denmark;
and had I any thoughts about my wrongs, soothed
me with promises of near redress. I should espouse
his daughter, young Angelica; we two indeed
should reign in Paflagonia. His words were false—false
as Angelica’s heart!—false as Angelica’s
hair, color, front teeth! She looked with her skew
eyes upon young Bulbo, Crim Tartary’s stupid
heir, and she preferred him. ’Twas then I turned
my eyes upon Betsinda—Rosalba, as she now is.
And I saw in her the blushing sum of all perfection;
the pink of maiden modesty; the nymph
that my fond heart had ever woo’d in dreams,”
etc., etc.</p>

<p>(I don’t give this speech, which was very fine,
but very long; and though Smith and Jones knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
nothing about the circumstances, my dear reader
does, so I go on.)</p>

<p>The Prince and his young friends hastened home
to his apartment, highly excited by the intelligence,
as no doubt by the <em>royal narrator’s</em> admirable
manner of recounting it, and they ran up to
his room where he had worked so hard at his
books.</p>

<p>On his writing-table was his bag, grown so long
that the Prince could not help remarking it. He
went to it, opened it, and what do you think he
found in it?</p>

<p>A splendid long, gold-handled, red-velvet-scabbarded,
cut-and-thrust sword, and on the sheath
was embroidered “<span class="smcap">Rosalba for Ever!</span>”</p>

<p>He drew out the sword, which flashed and illuminated
the whole room, and called out “Rosalba
for ever!” Smith and Jones following him, but
quite respectfully this time, and taking the time
from His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>And now his trunk opened with a sudden pong,
and out there came three ostrich feathers in a gold
crown, surrounding a beautiful shining steel helmet,
a cuirass, a pair of spurs, finally a complete
suit of armor.</p>

<p>The books on Giglio’s shelves were all gone.
Where there had been some great dictionaries,
Giglio’s friends found two pairs of jack-boots
labelled, “Lieutenant Smith,” “—Jones, Esq.,”
which fitted them to a nicety. Besides, there were
helmets, back and breast plates, swords, etc., just
like in Mr. G. P. R. James’s novels; and that
evening three cavaliers might have been seen issuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
from the gates of Bosforo, in whom the porters,
proctors, etc., never thought of recognizing the
young Prince and his friends.</p>

<p>They got horses at a livery stable-keeper’s, and
never drew bridle until they reached the last town
on the frontier before you come to Crim Tartary.
Here, as their animals were tired, and the cavaliers
hungry, they stopped and refreshed at an hostel.
I could make a chapter of this if I were like some
writers, but I like to cram my measure tight down,
you see, and give you a great deal for your money,
and, in a word, they had some bread and cheese and
ale upstairs on the balcony of the inn. As they
were drinking, drums and trumpets sounded nearer
and nearer, the market-place was filled with
soldiers, and His Royal Highness looking forth,
recognized the Paflagonian banners, and the Paflagonian
national air which the bands were playing.</p>

<p>The troops all made for the tavern at once, and
as they came up Giglio exclaimed, on beholding
their leader, “Whom do I see? Yes! No! It is,
it is! Phoo! No, it can’t be! Yes! It is my friend,
my gallant faithful veteran, Captain Hedzoff! Ho!
Hedzoff! Knowest thou not thy Prince, thy
Giglio? Good Corporal, methinks we once were
friends. Ha, Sergeant, an my memory serves me
right, we have had many a bout at singlestick.”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, we have a many, good my Lord,” says
the Sergeant.</p>

<p>“Tell me, what means this mighty armament,”
continued His Royal Highness from the balcony,
“and whither march my Paflagonians?”</p>

<p>Hedzoff’s head fell. “My Lord,” he said, “we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
march as the allies of great Padella, Crim Tartary’s
monarch.”</p>

<p>“Crim Tartary’s usurper, gallant Hedzoff?
Crim Tartary’s grim tyrant, honest Hedzoff!” said
the Prince, on the balcony, quite sarcastically.</p>

<p>“A soldier, Prince, must needs obey his orders:
mine are to help His Majesty Padella. And also
(though alack that I should say it!) to seize
wherever I should light upon him—”</p>

<p>“First catch your hare! ha, Hedzoff!” exclaimed
His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>“—On the body of <em>Giglio</em>, whilome Prince of
Paflagonia,” Hedzoff went on, with indescribable
emotion. “My Prince, give up your sword without
ado. Look! we are thirty thousand men to one!”</p>

<p>“Give up my sword! Giglio give up his sword!”
cried the Prince; and stepping well forward on to
the balcony, the royal youth, <em>without preparation</em>,
delivered a speech so magnificent that no report
can do justice to it. It was all in blank verse (in
which, from this time, he invariably spoke, as more
becoming his majestic station). It lasted for three
days and three nights, during which not a single
person who heard him was tired, or remarked the
difference between daylight and dark. The soldiers
only cheering tremendously, when occasionally,
once in nine hours, the Prince paused to suck an
orange, which Jones took out of the bag. He explained,
in terms which we say we shall not attempt
to convey, the whole history of the previous transaction,
and his determination not only not to give up
his sword, but to assume his rightful crown; and at
the end of this extraordinary, this truly <em>gigantic</em> effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Captain Hedzoff flung up his helmet, and
cried, “Hurray! Hurray! Long live King Giglio!”</p>

<p>Such were the consequences of having employed
his time well at College.</p>

<p>When the excitement had ceased, beer was ordered
out for the army, and their Sovereign himself
did not disdain a little! And now it was with some
alarm that Captain Hedzoff told him his division
was only the advanced guard of the Paflagonian
contingent, hastening to King Padella’s aid; the
main force being a day’s march in the rear under
His Royal Highness Prince Bulbo.</p>

<p>“We will wait here, good friend, to beat the
Prince,” His Majesty said, “and <em>then</em> will make
his royal father wince.”</p>

<h3 id="ch15">XV<br />
<span class="smaller">WE RETURN TO ROSALBA</span></h3>

<p>King Padella made very similar proposals to
Rosalba to those which she had received from the
various princes who, as we have seen, had fallen in
love with her. His Majesty was a widower, and
offered to marry his fair captive that instant, but
she declined his invitation in her usual polite gentle
manner, stating that Prince Giglio was her love,
and that any other union was out of the question.
Having tried tears and supplications in vain, this
violent-tempered monarch menaced her with threats
and tortures; but she declared she would rather suffer
all these than accept the hand of her father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
murderer, who left her finally, uttering the most
awful imprecations, and bidding her prepare for
death on the following morning.</p>

<p>All night long the King spent in advising how
he should get rid of this obdurate young creature.
Cutting off her head was much too easy a death
for her; hanging was so common in His Majesty’s
dominions that it no longer afforded him any sport;
finally, he bethought himself of a pair of fierce lions
which had lately been sent to him as presents, and
he determined, with these ferocious brutes, to hunt
poor Rosalba down. Adjoining his castle was an
amphitheatre where the Prince indulged in bull-baiting,
rat-hunting, and other ferocious sports.
The two lions were kept in a cage under this place;
their roaring might be heard over the whole city,
the inhabitants of which, I am sorry to say, thronged
in numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by
two wild beasts.</p>

<p>The King took his place in the royal box, having
the officers of his Court around and the Count
Hogginarmo by his side, upon whom His Majesty
was observed to look very fiercely; the fact is, royal
spies had told the monarch of Hogginarmo’s behavior,
his proposals to Rosalba, and his offer to
fight for the crown. Black as thunder looked King
Padella at this proud noble, as they sat in the front
seats of the theatre waiting to see the tragedy
whereof poor Rosalba was to be the heroine.</p>

<p>At length that Princess was brought out in her
nightgown, with all her beautiful hair falling down
her back, and looking so pretty that even the beef-eaters
and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
at seeing her. And she walked with her poor
little feet (only luckily the arena was covered with
sawdust), and went and leaned up against a great
stone in the center of the amphitheatre, round
which the Court and the people were seated in
boxes, with bars before
them, for fear of the great,
fierce, red-maned, black-throated,
long-tailed, roaring,
bellowing, rushing
lions. And now the gates
were opened, and with a
wurrawarrurawarar two
great lean, hungry, roaring
lions rushed out of
their den, where they had
been kept for three weeks
on nothing but a little
toast-and-water and dashed
straight up to the stone
where poor Rosalba was
waiting. Commend her to
your patron saints, all you kind people, for she is
in a dreadful state!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray20.jpg" width="225" height="400" alt="Rosalba" />
</div>

<p>There was a hum and a buzz all through the circus,
and the fierce King Padella even felt a little
compassion. But Count Hogginarmo, seated by
His Majesty, roared out “Hurray! Now for it!
Soo-soo-soo!” that nobleman being uncommonly
angry still at Rosalba’s refusal of him.</p>

<p>But O strange event! O remarkable circumstance!
O extraordinary coincidence, which I am
sure none of you could <em>by any possibility</em> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
divined! When the lions came to Rosalba, instead
of devouring her with their great teeth, it was with
kisses they gobbled her up! They licked her pretty
feet, they nuzzled their noses in her lap, they moo’d,
they seemed to say, “Dear, dear sister, don’t you
recollect your brothers in the forest?” And she
put her pretty white arms round their tawny necks,
and kissed them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/thackeray21.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="The lions" />
</div>

<p>King Padella was immensely astonished. The
Count Hogginarmo was extremely disgusted.
“Pooh!” the Count cried. “Gammon!” exclaimed
his Lordship. “These lions are tame beasts come
from Wombwell’s or Astley’s. It is a shame to
put people off in this way. I believe they are little
boys dressed up in doormats. They are no lions
at all.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the King, “you dare to say ‘gammon’
to your Sovereign, do you? These lions are no
lions at all, aren’t they? Ho! my beef-eaters! Ho!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
my bodyguard! Take this Count Hogginarmo
and fling him into the circus! Give him a sword
and buckler, let him keep his armor on, and his
weather-eye out and fight these lions.”</p>

<p>The haughty Hogginarmo laid down his opera-glass,
and looked scowling round at the King and
his attendants. “Touch me not, dogs!” he said,
“or by St. Nicholas the Elder, I will gore you!
Your Majesty thinks Hogginarmo is afraid? No,
not of a hundred thousand lions! Follow me
down into the circus, King Padella, and match thyself
against one of yon brutes. Thou darest not.
Let them both come on, then!” And opening a
grating of the box, he jumped lightly down into
the circus.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wurra wurra wurra wur-aw-aw-aw!!!</i><br />
In about two minutes<br />
The Count Hogginarmo was<br />
<span class="smcapuc">GOBBLED UP</span><br />
by<br />
those lions,<br />
bones, boots, and all,<br />
and<br />
There was an<br />
End of him</p>

<p>At this, the King said, “Serve him right, the rebellious
ruffian! And now, as those lions won’t eat
that young woman—”</p>

<p>“Let her off!—let her off!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>“NO!” roared the King. “Let the beef-eaters go
down and chop her into small pieces. If the lions
defend her, let the archers shoot them to death.
That hussy shall die in tortures!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>“A-a-ah!” cried the crowd. “Shame! shame!”</p>

<p>“Who dares cry out shame?” cried the furious
potentate (so little can tyrants command their
passions). “Fling any scoundrel who says a word
down among the lions!”</p>

<p>I warrant you there was a dead silence then,
which was broken by a Pang arang pang pangkarangpang,
and a Knight and a Herald rode in
at the further end of the circus: the Knight, in full
armor, with his vizor up, and bearing a letter on
the point of his lance.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the King, “by my fay, ’tis
Elephant and Castle, pursuivant of my brother of
Paflagonia; and the Knight, an my memory serves
me, is the gallant Captain Hedzoff! What news
from Paflagonia, gallant Hedzoff? Elephant and
Castle, beshrew me, thy trumpeting must have made
thee thirsty. What will my trusty herald like to
drink?”</p>

<p>“Bespeaking first safe conduct from your Lordship,”
said Captain Hedzoff, “before we take a
drink of anything, permit us to deliver our King’s
message.”</p>

<p>“My Lordship, ha!” said Crim Tartary, frowning
terrifically. “That title soundeth strange in
the anointed ears of a crowned King. Straightway
speak out your message, Knight and Herald!”</p>

<p>Reining up his charger in a most elegant manner
close under the King’s balcony, Hedzoff turned
to the Herald, and bade him begin.</p>

<p>Elephant and Castle, dropping his trumpet over
his shoulder, took a large sheet of paper out of his
hat, and began to read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Yes! O Yes! O Yes! Know all men by
these presents, that we, Giglio, King of Paflagonia,
Grand Duke of Cappadocia, Sovereign Prince of
Turkey and the Sausage Islands, having assumed
our rightful throne and title, long time falsely
borne by our usurping Uncle, styling himself King
of Paflagonia—”</p>

<p>“Ha!” growled Padella.</p>

<p>“Hereby summon the false traitor, Padella, calling
himself King of Crim Tartary—”</p>

<p>The King’s curses were dreadful. “Go on, Elephant
and Castle!” said the intrepid Hedzoff.</p>

<p>“—To release from cowardly imprisonment his
liege lady and rightful Sovereign, Rosalba, Queen
of Crim Tartary, and restore her to her royal
throne: in default of which I, Giglio, proclaim the
said Padella sneak, traitor, humbug, usurper, and
coward. I challenge him to meet me, with fists or
with pistols, with battle-axe or sword, with blunderbuss
or singlestick, alone or at the head of his army,
on foot or on horseback; and will prove my words
upon his wicked ugly body!”</p>

<p>“God save the King!” said Captain Hedzoff,
executing a demivolte, two semilunes, and three
caracols.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” said Padella, with the terrific calm
of concentrated fury.</p>

<p>“That, sir, is all my royal master’s message.
Here is His Majesty’s letter in autograph, and
here is his glove, and if any gentleman of Crim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
Tartary chooses to find fault with His Majesty’s
expressions, I, Tuffskin Hedzoff, Captain of the
Guard, am very much at his service,” and he waved
his lance, and looked at the assembly all round.</p>

<p>“And what says my good brother of Paflagonia,
my dear son’s father-in-law, to this rubbish?” asked
the King.</p>

<p>“The King’s uncle hath been deprived of the
crown he unjustly wore,” said Hedzoff gravely.
“He and his ex-minister, Glumboso, are now in
prison waiting the sentence of my royal master.
After the battle of Bombardaro—”</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked the surprised Padella.</p>

<p>“Of Bombardaro, where my liege, his present
Majesty, would have performed prodigies of
valor, but that the whole of his uncle’s army came
over to our side, with the exception of Prince
Bulbo.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my boy, my boy, my Bulbo was no traitor!”
cried Padella.</p>

<p>“Prince Bulbo, far from coming over to us, ran
away, sir; but I caught him. The Prince is a prisoner
in our army, and the most terrific tortures
await him if a hair of the Princess Rosalba’s head
is injured.”</p>

<p>“Do they?” exclaimed the furious Padella, who
was now perfectly <em>livid</em> with rage. “Do they indeed?
So much the worse for Bulbo. I’ve twenty
sons as lovely each as Bulbo. Not one but is as fit
to reign as Bulbo. Whip, whack, flog, starve, rack,
punish, torture Bulbo—break all his bones—roast
him or flay him alive—pull all his pretty teeth out
one by one! But justly dear as Bulbo is to me—joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
of my eyes, fond treasure of my soul!—Ha,
ha, ha, ha! revenge is dearer still. Ho! torturers,
rackmen, executioners—light up the fires and make
the pincers hot! get lots of boiling lead!—Bring out
Rosalba!”</p>

<h3 id="ch16">XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW HEDZOFF RODE BACK AGAIN TO KING GIGLIO</span></h3>

<p>Captain Hedzoff rode away when King Padella
uttered this cruel command, having done his
duty in delivering the message with which his royal
master had entrusted him. Of course he was very
sorry for Rosalba, but what could he do?</p>

<p>So he returned to King Giglio’s camp, and
found the young monarch in a disturbed state of
mind, smoking cigars in the royal tent. His Majesty’s
agitation was not appeased by the news that
was brought by his ambassador. “The brutal ruthless
ruffian royal wretch!” Giglio exclaimed. “As
England’s poesy has well remarked, ‘The man that
lays his hand upon a woman, save in the way of
kindness, is a villain.’ Ha, Hedzoff!”</p>

<p>“That he is, your Majesty,” said the attendant.</p>

<p>“And didst thou see her flung into the oil? and
didn’t the soothing oil—the emollient oil, refuse to
boil, good Hedzoff—and to spoil the fairest lady
ever eyes did look on?”</p>

<p>“Faith, good my liege, I had no heart to look
and see a beauteous lady boiling down; I took your
royal message to Padella, and bore his back to you.
I told him you would hold Prince Bulbo answerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
He only said that he had twenty sons as
good as Bulbo, and forthwith he bade the ruthless
executioners proceed.”</p>

<p>“O cruel father—O unhappy son!” cried the
King. “Go, some of you, and bring Prince Bulbo
hither.”</p>

<p>Bulbo was brought in chains, looking very uncomfortable.
Though a prisoner, he had been tolerably
happy, perhaps because his mind was at
rest, and all the fighting was over, and he was
playing at marbles with his guards when the King
sent for him.</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor Bulbo,” said His Majesty, with
looks of infinite compassion, “hast thou heard the
news?” (for you see Giglio wanted to break the
thing gently to the Prince), “thy brutal father
has condemned Rosalba-p-p-p-ut her to death,
P-p-p-prince Bulbo!”</p>

<p>“What, killed Betsinda! Boo-hoo-hoo,” cried
out Bulbo. “Betsinda! pretty Betsinda! dear Betsinda!
She was the dearest little girl in the world.
I love her better twenty thousand times even than
Angelica,” and he went on expressing his grief in
so hearty and unaffected a manner that the King
was quite touched by it, and said, shaking Bulbo’s
hand, that he wished he had known Bulbo sooner.</p>

<p>Bulbo, quite unconsciously, and meaning for the
best, offered to come and sit with his Majesty,
and smoke a cigar with him, and console him. The
<em>royal kindness</em> supplied Bulbo with a cigar; he had
not had one, he said, since he was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>And now think what must have been the feelings
of the most <em>merciful of monarchs</em>, when he informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
his prisoner that, in consequence of King
Padella’s <em>cruel and dastardly behavior</em> to Rosalba,
Prince Bulbo must instantly be executed! The
noble Giglio could not restrain his tears, nor could
the Grenadiers, nor the officers, nor could Bulbo
himself, when the matter was explained to him, and
he was brought to understand that His Majesty’s
promise, of course, was <em>above every</em> thing, and
Bulbo must submit. So poor Bulbo was led out,
Hedzoff trying to console him, by pointing out
that if he had won the battle of Bombardaro, he
might have hanged Prince Giglio. “Yes! But
that is no comfort to me now!” said poor Bulbo;
nor indeed was it, poor fellow!</p>

<p>He was told the business would be done the next
morning at eight, and was taken back to his dungeon,
where every attention was paid to him. The
gaoler’s wife sent him tea, and the turnkey’s daughter
begged him to write his name in her album,
where a many gentlemen had wrote it on like occasions!
“Bother your album!” says Bulbo. The
Undertaker came and measured him for the handsomest
coffin which money could buy—even this
didn’t console Bulbo. The Cook brought him
dishes which he once used to like; but he wouldn’t
touch them: he sat down and began writing an
adieu to Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking,
and the hands drawing nearer to next morning.
The Barber came in at night, and offered to shave
him for the next day. Prince Bulbo kicked him
away, and went on writing a few words to Princess
Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking, and the
hands hopping nearer and nearer to next morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
He got up on the top of a hat-box, on the top of a
chair, on the top of his bed, on the top of his table,
and looked out to see whether he might escape, as
the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing
nearer, and nearer, and nearer.</p>

<p>But looking out of the window was one thing,
and jumping another: and the town clock struck
seven. So he got into bed for a little sleep, but
the gaoler came and woke him, and said, “Git up,
your Royal Ighness, if you please, it’s <em>ten minutes
to eight</em>!”</p>

<p>So poor Bulbo got up: he had gone to bed in his
clothes (the lazy boy), and he shook himself, and
said he didn’t mind about dressing, or having any
breakfast, thank you; and he saw the soldiers who
had come for him. “Lead on!” he said; and they
led the way, deeply affected; and they came into
the courtyard, and out into the square, and there
was King Giglio come to take leave of him, and
His Majesty most kindly shook hands with him,
and the <em>gloomy procession</em> marched on—when
hark!</p>

<p>Haw—wurraw—wurraw—aworr!</p>

<p>A roar of wild beasts was heard. And who
should come riding into the town, frightening away
the boys, and even the beadle and policeman, but
Rosalba!</p>

<p>The fact is, that when Captain Hedzoff entered
into the court of Snapdragon Castle, and was discoursing
with King Padella, the lions made a dash
at the open gate, gobbled up the six beef-eaters in
a jiffy, and away they went with Rosalba on the
back of one of them, and they carried her, turn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
turn about, till they came to the city where Prince
Giglio’s army was encamped.</p>

<p>When the King heard of the Queen’s arrival,
you may think how he rushed out of his breakfast-room
to hand Her Majesty off her lion! The lions
were grown as fat as pigs now, having had Hogginarmo
and all those
beef-eaters, and were
so tame anybody
might pat them.</p>

<p>While Giglio knelt
(most gracefully)
and helped the Princess,
Bulbo, for his
part, rushed up and
kissed the lion. He
flung his arms round
the forest monarch;
he hugged him, and
laughed and cried for
joy. “Oh, you darling
old beast, oh,
how glad I am to see you, and the dear, dear Bets—that
is, Rosalba.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/thackeray22.jpg" width="225" height="275" alt="Giglio, helping Rosalba dismount from a lion" />
</div>

<p>“What, is it you? poor Bulbo!” said the Queen.
“Oh, how glad I am to see you,” and she gave him
her hand to kiss. King Giglio slapped him most
kindly on the back, and said, “Bulbo, my boy, I am
delighted, for your sake, that Her Majesty has
arrived.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Bulbo; “and <em>you know why</em>.”
Captain Hedzoff here came up. “Sire, it is half-past
eight: shall we proceed with the execution?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>“Execution! what for?” asked Bulbo.</p>

<p>“An officer only knows his orders,” replied Captain
Hedzoff, showing his warrant, on which His
Majesty King Giglio smilingly said, “Prince Bulbo
was reprieved this time,” and most graciously invited
him to breakfast.</p>

<h3 id="ch17">XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW A TREMENDOUS BATTLE TOOK PLACE, AND WHO WON IT</span></h3>

<p>As soon as King Padella heard, what we know
already, that his victim, the lovely Rosalba, had
escaped him, His Majesty’s fury knew no bounds,
and he pitched the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chamberlain,
and every officer of the Crown whom he
could set eyes on, into the cauldron of boiling oil
prepared for the Princess.</p>

<p>Then he ordered out his whole army, horse,
foot, and artillery; and set forth at the head
of an innumerable host, and I should think
twenty thousand drummers, trumpeters, and
fifers.</p>

<p>King Giglio’s advanced guard, you may be sure,
kept that monarch acquainted with the enemy’s
dealings, and he was in no wise disconcerted. He
was much too polite to alarm the Princess, his
lovely guest, with any unnecessary rumors of
battles impending; on the contrary, he did everything
to amuse and divert her; gave her a most
elegant breakfast, dinner, lunch, and got up a ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
for her that evening, when he danced with her every
single dance.</p>

<p>Poor Bulbo was taken into favor again, and
allowed to go quite free now. He had new clothes
given him, was called “My good cousin” by His
Majesty, and was treated with the greatest distinction
by everybody. But it was easy to see he was
very melancholy. The fact is, the sight of Betsinda,
who looked perfectly lovely in an elegant new
dress, set poor Bulbo frantic in love with her again.
And he never thought about Angelica, now Princess
Bulbo, whom he had left at home, and who, as
we know, did not care much about him.</p>

<p>The King, dancing the twenty-fifth polka with
Rosalba, remarked with wonder the ring she wore;
and then Rosalba told him how she had got it from
Gruffanuff, who no doubt had picked it up when
Angelica flung it away.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says the Fairy Blackstick, who had come
to see the young people, and who had very likely
certain plans regarding them. “That ring I gave
the Queen, Giglio’s mother, who was not, saving
your presence, a very wise woman; it is enchanted,
and whoever wears it looks beautiful in the eyes
of the world. I made poor Prince Bulbo, when he
was christened, the present of a rose which made
him look handsome while he had it; but he gave it
to Angelica, who instantly looked beautiful again,
whilst Bulbo relapsed into his natural plainness.”</p>

<p>“Rosalba needs no ring, I am sure,” says Giglio,
with a low bow. “She is beautiful enough, in my
eyes, without any enchanted aid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” said Rosalba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take off the ring and try,” said the King, and
resolutely drew the ring off her finger. In <em>his</em>
eyes she looked just as handsome as before!</p>

<p>The King was thinking of throwing the ring
away, as it was so dangerous and made all the
people so mad about Rosalba; but being a Prince
of great humor, and good humor too, he cast eyes
upon a poor youth who happened to be looking on
very disconsolately, and said—</p>

<p>“Bulbo, my poor lad! come and try on this
ring. The Princess Rosalba makes it a present
to you.”</p>

<p>The magic properties of this ring were uncommonly
strong, for no sooner had Bulbo put it on,
but lo and behold, he appeared a personable, agreeable
young Prince enough—with a fine complexion,
fair hair, rather stout, and with bandy legs; but
these were encased in such a beautiful pair of
yellow morocco boots that nobody remarked them.
And Bulbo’s spirits rose up almost immediately
after he had looked in the glass, and he talked to
their Majesties in the most lively, agreeable manner,
and danced opposite the Queen with one of the
prettiest maids of honor, and after looking at Her
Majesty, could not help saying—</p>

<p>“How very odd! she is very pretty, but not so
<em>extraordinarily</em> handsome.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, by no means!” says the Maid of Honor.</p>

<p>“But what care I, dear sir,” says the Queen, who
overheard them, “if <em>you</em> think I am good-looking
enough?”</p>

<p>His Majesty’s glance in reply to this affectionate
speech was such that no painter could draw it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
the Fairy Blackstick said, “Bless you, my darling
children! Now you are united and happy; and
now you see what I said from the first, that a little
misfortune has done you both good. <em>You</em>, Giglio,
had you been bred in prosperity, would scarcely
have learned to read or write—you would have been
idle and extravagant, and could not have been a
good King as now you will be. You, Rosalba,
would have been so flattered, that your little head
might have been turned like Angelica’s, who
thought herself too good for Giglio.”</p>

<p>“As if anybody could be good enough for <em>him</em>,”
cried Rosalba.</p>

<p>“Oh, you, you darling!” says Giglio. And so
she was! and he was just holding out his arms in
order to give her a hug before the whole company,
when a messenger came rushing in, and said, “My
Lord, the enemy!”</p>

<p>“To arms!” cries Giglio.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” says Rosalba, and fainted of
course.</p>

<p>He snatched one kiss from her lips, and rushed
<em>forth to the field</em> of battle!</p>

<p class="tb">The Fairy had provided King Giglio with a suit
of armor, which was not only embroidered all over
with jewels, and blinding to your eyes to look at,
but was water-proof, gun-proof, and sword-proof;
so that in the midst of the very hottest battles His
Majesty rode about as calmly as if he had been a
British Grenadier at Alma. Were I engaged in
fighting for my country, <em>I</em> should like such a suit
of armor as Prince Giglio wore; but, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
he was a Prince of a fairy tale, and they always
have these wonderful things.</p>

<p>Besides the fairy armor, the Prince had a fairy
horse, which would gallop at any pace you please;
and a fairy sword, which would lengthen and run
through a whole regiment of enemies at once. With
such a weapon at command, I wonder, for my part,
he thought of ordering his army out; but forth they
all came, in magnificent new uniforms, Hedzoff
and the Prince’s two college friends each commanding
a division, and His Majesty prancing in person
at the head of them all.</p>

<p>Ah! if I had the pen of a Sir Archibald Alison,
my dear friends, would I not now entertain you
with the account of a most tremendous shindy?
Should not fine blows be struck? dreadful wounds
be delivered? arrows darken the air? cannon balls
crash through the battalions? cavalry charge infantry?
infantry pitch into cavalry? bugles blow;
drums beat; horses neigh; fifes sing; soldiers roar,
swear, hurray; officers shout out “Forward, my
men!” “This way, lads!” “Give it ’em, boys!”
“Fight for King Giglio, and the cause of right!”
“King Padella for ever!” Would I not describe all
this, I say, and in the very finest language too?
But this humble pen does not possess the skill necessary
for the description of combats. In a word,
the overthrow of King Padella’s army was so complete,
that if they had been Russians you could not
have wished them to be more utterly smashed and
confounded.</p>

<p>As for that usurping monarch, having performed
acts of valor much more considerable than could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
be expected of a royal ruffian and usurper, who had
such a bad cause, and who was so cruel to women—as
for King Padella, I say, when his army ran
away, the King ran away too, kicking his first general,
Prince Punchikoff, from his saddle, and galloping
away on the Prince’s horse, having, indeed,
had twenty-five or twenty-six of his own shot under
him. Hedzoff coming up, and finding Punchikoff
down, as you may imagine, very speedily disposed
of <em>him</em>. Meanwhile King Padella was scampering
off as hard as his horse could lay legs to ground.
Fast as he scampered, I promise you somebody else
galloped faster; and that individual, as no doubt
you are aware, was the Royal Giglio, who kept
bawling out, “Stay, traitor! Turn, miscreant, and
defend thyself! Stand, tyrant, coward, ruffian,
royal wretch, till I cut thy ugly head from thy
usurping shoulders!” And, with his fairy sword,
which elongated itself at will, His Majesty kept
poking and prodding Padella in the back, until that
wicked monarch roared with anguish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/thackeray23.jpg" width="350" height="250" alt="Battle" />
</div>

<p>When he was fairly brought to bay, Padella
turned and dealt Prince Giglio a prodigious crack
over the sconce with his battle-axe, a most enormous
weapon, which had cut down I don’t know how
many regiments in the course of the afternoon.
But, Law bless you! though the blow fell right
down on His Majesty’s helmet, it made no more
impression than if Padella had struck him with a
pat of butter: his battle-axe crumpled up in
Padella’s hand, and the Royal Giglio laughed for
very scorn at the impotent efforts of that atrocious
usurper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;" id="illus7">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>At the ill success of his blow the Crim Tartar
monarch was justly irritated. “If,” says he to
Giglio, “you ride a fairy horse, and wear fairy armor,
what on earth is the use of my hitting you? I
may as well
give myself up
a prisoner at
once. Your
Majesty won’t,
I suppose, be
so mean as to
strike a poor
fellow who
can’t strike
again?”</p>

<p>The justice
of Padella’s remark struck the magnanimous Giglio.
“Do you yield yourself a prisoner, Padella?”
says he.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” says Padella.</p>

<p>“Do you acknowledge Rosalba as your rightful
Queen, and give up the crown and all your treasures
to your rightful mistress?”</p>

<p>“If I must, I must,” says Padella, who was naturally
very sulky.</p>

<p>By this time King Giglio’s aides-de-camp had
come up, whom His Majesty ordered to bind the
prisoner. And they tied his hands behind him, and
bound his legs tight under his horse, having set him
with his face to the tail; and in this fashion he was
led back to King Giglio’s quarters, and thrust into
the very dungeon where young Bulbo had been
confined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>Padella (who was a very different person in the
depth of his distress to Padella the proud wearer
of the Crim Tartary crown), now most affectionately
and earnestly asked to see his son—his dear
eldest boy—his darling Bulbo; and that good-natured
young man never once reproached his
haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before,
when he would have left Bulbo to be shot
without any pity, but came to see his father, and
spoke to him through the grating of the door, beyond
which he was not allowed to go; and brought
him some sandwiches from the grand supper which
His Majesty was giving above stairs, in honor of
the brilliant victory which had just been achieved.</p>

<p>“I cannot stay with you long, sir,” says Bulbo,
who was in his best ball dress, as he handled his
father in the prog, “I am engaged to dance the
next quadrille with Her Majesty Queen Rosalba,
and I hear the fiddles playing at this very moment.”</p>

<p>So Bulbo went back to the ball-room, and the
wretched Padella ate his solitary supper in silence
and tears.</p>

<p class="tb">All was now joy in King Giglio’s circle. Dancing,
feasting, fun, illuminations, and jollifications
of all sorts ensued. The people through whose villages
they passed were ordered to illuminate their
cottages at night, and scatter flowers on the roads
during the day. They were requested, and I
promise you they did not like to refuse, to serve the
troops liberally with eatables and wine; besides, the
army was enriched by the immense quantity of
plunder which was found in King Padella’s camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
and taken from his soldiers; who (after they had
given up everything) were allowed to fraternise
with the conquerors; and the united forces marched
back by easy stages towards King Giglio’s capital,
his royal banner and that of Queen Rosalba being
carried in front of the troops. Hedzoff was made
a Duke and a Field-Marshal. Smith and Jones
were promoted to be Earls; the Crim Tartar Order
of the Pumpkin and the Paflagonian decoration of
the Cucumber were freely distributed by their
Majesties to the army. Queen Rosalba wore the
Paflagonian Ribbon of the Cucumber across her
riding-habit, whilst King Giglio never appeared
without the grand Cordon of the Pumpkin. How
the people cheered them as they rode along side by
side! They were pronounced to be the handsomest
couple ever seen: that was a matter of course; but
they really <em>were</em> very handsome, and, had they
been otherwise, would have looked so, they were so
happy! Their Majesties were never separated
during the whole day, but breakfasted, dined and
supped together always, and rode side by side, interchanging
elegant compliments, and indulging in
the most delightful conversation. At night, Her
Majesty’s ladies of honor (who had all rallied
round her the day after King Padella’s defeat)
came and conducted her to the apartments prepared
for her; whilst King Giglio, surrounded by
his gentlemen, withdrew to his own royal quarters.
It was agreed they should be married as soon as
they reached the capital, and orders were despatched
to the Archbishop of Blombodinga, to
hold himself in readiness to perform the interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
ceremony. Duke Hedzoff carried the message,
and gave instructions to have the Royal Castle
splendidly refurnished and painted afresh. The
Duke seized Glumboso, the Ex-Prime Minister,
and made him refund that considerable sum of
money which the old scoundrel had secreted out of
the late King’s treasure. He also clapped Valoroso
into prison (who, by the way, had been dethroned
for some considerable period past), and
when the Ex-Monarch weakly remonstrated, Hedzoff
said, “A soldier, sir, knows but his duty; my
orders are to lock you up along with the Ex-King
Padella, whom I have brought hither a prisoner
under guard.” So these two Ex-Royal personages
were sent for a year to the House of Correction,
and thereafter were obliged to become monks
of the severest Order of Flagellants, in which state,
by fasting, by vigils, by flogging (which they administered
to one another, humbly but resolutely),
no doubt they exhibited a repentance for their past
misdeeds, usurpations, and private and public
crimes.</p>

<p>As for Glumboso, that rogue was sent to the
galleys, and never had an opportunity to steal any
more.</p>

<h3 id="ch18">XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW THEY ALL JOURNEYED BACK TO THE CAPITAL</span></h3>

<p>The Fairy Blackstick, by whose means this
young King and Queen had certainly won their respective
crowns back, would come not unfrequently,
to pay them a little visit—as they were
riding in their triumphal progress towards Giglio’s
capital—change her wand into a pony, and travel
by their Majesties’ side, giving them the very best
advice. I am not sure that King Giglio did not
think the Fairy and her advice rather a bore,
fancying it was his own valor and merits which
had put him on his throne, and conquered Padella:
and, in fine, I fear he rather gave himself airs towards
his best friend and patroness. She exhorted
him to deal justly by his subjects, to draw mildly on
the taxes, never to break his promise when he had
once given it—and in all respects to be a good
King.</p>

<p>“A good King, my dear Fairy!” cries Rosalba.
“Of course he will. Break his promise! can you
fancy my Giglio would ever do anything so improper,
so unlike him? No! never!” And she
looked fondly towards Giglio, whom she thought
a pattern of perfection.</p>

<p>“Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me,
and telling me how to manage my government, and
warning me to keep my word? Does she suppose
that I am not a man of sense, and a man of
honor?” asks Giglio testily. “Methinks she rather
presumes upon her position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush! dear Giglio,” says Rosalba. “You
know Blackstick has been very kind to us, and we
must not offend her.” But the Fairy was not
listening to Giglio’s testy observations, she had
fallen back, and was trotting on her pony now, by
Master Bulbo’s side, who rode a donkey, and made
himself generally beloved in the army by his cheerfulness,
kindness, and good-humor to everybody.
He was eager to see his darling Angelica. He
thought there never was such a charming being.
Blackstick did not tell him it was the possession of
the magic rose that made Angelica so lovely in his
eyes. She brought him the very best accounts of
his little wife, whose misfortunes and humiliations
had indeed very greatly improved her; and, you see,
she could whisk off on her wand a hundred miles in
a minute, and be back in no time, and so carry polite
messages from Bulbo to Angelica, and from Angelica
to Bulbo, and comfort that young man upon
his journey.</p>

<p>When the Royal party arrived at the last stage
before you reach Blombodinga, who should be in
waiting, in her carriage there with her lady of
honor by her side, but the Princess Angelica! She
rushed into her husband’s arms, scarcely stopping
to make a passing curtsey to the King and Queen.
She had no eyes but for Bulbo, who appeared perfectly
lovely, to her on account of the fairy ring
which he wore; whilst she herself, wearing the magic
rose in her bonnet, seemed entirely beautiful to the
enraptured Bulbo.</p>

<p>A splendid luncheon was served to the Royal
party, of which the Archbishop, the Chancellor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
Duke Hedzoff, Countess Gruffanuff, and all our
friends partook, the Fairy Blackstick being seated
on the left of King Giglio, with Bulbo and Angelica
beside her. You could hear the joy-bells ringing in
the capital, and the guns which the citizens were
firing off in honor of their Majesties.</p>

<p>“What can have induced that hideous old Gruffanuff
to dress herself up in such an absurd way?
Did you ask her to be your bridesmaid, my dear?”
says Giglio to Rosalba. “What a figure of fun
Gruffy is!”</p>

<p>Gruffy was seated opposite their Majesties, between
the Archbishop and the Lord Chancellor,
and a figure of fun she certainly was, for she was
dressed in a low white silk dress, with lace over, a
wreath of white roses on her wig, a splendid lace
veil, and her yellow old neck was covered with
diamonds. She ogled the King in such a manner
that His Majesty burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Eleven o’clock!” cries Giglio, as the great
Cathedral bell of Blombodinga tolled that hour.
“Gentlemen and ladies, we must be starting. Archbishop,
you must be at church, I think, before
twelve?”</p>

<p>“We must be at church before twelve,” sighs out
Gruffanuff in a languishing voice, hiding her old
face behind her fan.</p>

<p>“And then I shall be the happiest man in my
dominions,” cries Giglio, with an elegant bow to the
blushing Rosalba.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Giglio! Oh, my dear Majesty!” exclaims
Gruffanuff; “and can it be that this happy
moment at length has arrived—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it has arrived,” says the King.</p>

<p>“—And that I am about to become the enraptured
bride of my adored Giglio!” continues Gruffanuff.
“Lend me a smelling-bottle, somebody.
I certainly shall faint with joy.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> my bride?” roars out Giglio.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> marry my Prince?” cried poor little
Rosalba.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Nonsense! The woman’s mad!” exclaims
the King. And all the courtiers exhibited by their
countenances and expressions, marks of surprise,
or ridicule, or incredulity, or wonder.</p>

<p>“I should like to know who else is going to be
married if I am not?” shrieks out Gruffanuff.
“I should like to know if King Giglio is a gentleman,
and if there is such a thing as justice in Paflagonia?
Lord Chancellor! my Lord Archbishop!
will your Lordships sit by and see a poor, fond, confiding,
tender creature put upon? Has not Prince
Giglio promised to marry his Barbara? Is not this
Giglio’s signature? Does not this paper declare
that he is mine, and only mine?” And she handed
to his Grace the Archbishop the document which
the Prince signed that evening when she wore the
magic ring, and Giglio drank so much champagne.
And the old Archbishop, taking out his eyeglasses,
read—“This is to give notice, that I, Giglio, only
son of Savio, King of Paflagonia, hereby promise
to marry the charming Barbara Griselda, Countess
Gruffanuff, and widow of the late Jenkins Gruffanuff,
Esq.’”</p>

<p>“H’m,” says the Archbishop, “the document is
certainly a—a document.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>“Phoo!” says the Lord Chancellor, “the signature
is not in His Majesty’s handwriting.” Indeed,
since his studies at Bosforo, Giglio had made an
immense improvement in caligraphy.</p>

<p>“Is it your handwriting, Giglio?” cries the
Fairy Blackstick, with an awful severity of
countenance.</p>

<p>“Y—y—y—es,” poor Giglio gasps out, “I had
quite forgotten the confounded paper: she can’t
mean to hold me by it. You old wretch, what will
you take to let me off? Help the Queen, some one—Her
Majesty has fainted.”</p>

<table class="nopad">

    <td class="nw">“Chop her head off!”</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td rowspan="3" class="valign">exclaim the impetuous Hedzoff, the ardent Smith, and the faithful Jones.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="nw">“Pitch her into the river!”</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>But Gruffanuff flung her arms round the Archbishop’s
neck, and bellowed out, “Justice, justice,
my Lord Chancellor!” so loudly, that her piercing
shrieks caused everybody to pause. As for Rosalba,
she was borne away lifeless by her ladies; and you
may imagine the look of agony which Giglio cast
towards that lovely being, as his hope, his joy, his
darling, his all in all, was thus removed, and in
her place the horrid old Gruffanuff rushed up
to his side, and once more shrieked out, “Justice,
justice!”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take that sum of money which
Glumboso hid?” says Giglio; “two hundred and
eighteen thousand millions, or thereabouts. It’s a
handsome sum.”</p>

<p>“I will have that and you too!” says Gruffanuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us throw the crown jewels into the bargain,”
gasps out Giglio.</p>

<p>“I will wear them by my Giglio’s side!” says
Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“Will half, three-quarters, five-sixths, nineteen-twentieths,
of my kingdom do, Countess?” asks the
trembling monarch.</p>

<p>“What were all Europe to me without <em>you</em>, my
Giglio?” cries Gruff, kissing his hand.</p>

<p>“I won’t, I can’t, I shan’t—I’ll resign the crown
first,” shouts Giglio, tearing away his hand; but
Gruff clung to it.</p>

<p>“I have a competency, my love,” she says,
“and with thee and a cottage thy Barbara will be
happy.”</p>

<p>Giglio was half mad with rage by this time. “I
will not marry her,” says he. “Oh, Fairy, Fairy,
give me counsel?” And as he spoke he looked wildly
round at the severe face of the Fairy Blackstick.</p>

<p>“‘Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me,
and warning me to keep my word? Does she suppose
that I am not a man of honor?’” said the
Fairy, quoting Giglio’s own haughty words. He
quailed under the brightness of her eyes; he felt
that there was no escape for him from that awful
inquisition.</p>

<p>“Well, Archbishop,” said he in a dreadful voice,
that made his Grace start, “since this Fairy has led
me to the height of happiness but to dash me down
into the depths of despair, since I am to lose
Rosalba, let me at least keep my honor. Get up,
Countess, and let us be married; I can keep my
word, but I can die afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear Giglio,” cries Gruffanuff, skipping
up, “I knew, I knew I could trust thee—I knew
that my Prince was the soul of honor. Jump into
your carriages, ladies and gentlemen, and let us go
to church at once; and as for dying, dear Giglio,
no, no:—thou wilt forget that insignificant little
chambermaid of a Queen—thou wilt live to be consoled
by thy Barbara! She wishes to be a Queen,
and not a Queen Dowager, my gracious Lord!”
And hanging upon poor Giglio’s arm, and leering
and grinning in his face in the most disgusting manner,
this old wretch tripped off in her white satin
shoes, and jumped into the very carriage which had
been got ready to convey Giglio and Rosalba to
church.</p>

<p>The cannons roared again, the bells pealed
triple-bobmajors, the people came out flinging
flowers upon the path of the royal bride and bridegroom,
and Gruff looked out of the gilt coach window
and bowed and grinned to them. Phoo! the
horrid old wretch!</p>

<h3 id="ch19">XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">AND NOW WE COME TO THE LAST SCENE IN THE
PANTOMIME</span></h3>

<p>The many ups and downs of her life had given
the Princess Rosalba prodigious strength of mind,
and that highly principled young woman presently
recovered from her fainting-fit, out of which Fairy
Blackstick, by a precious essence which the Fairy
always carried in her pocket, awakened her. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
of tearing her hair, crying, and bemoaning
herself, and fainting again, as many young women
would have done, Rosalba remembered that she
owed an example of firmness to her subjects; and
though she loved Giglio more than her life, was determined,
as she told the Fairy, not to interfere between
him and justice, or to cause him to break his
royal word.</p>

<p>“I cannot marry him, but I shall love him always,”
says she to Blackstick; “I will go and be
present at his marriage with the Countess, and sign
the book, and wish them happy with all my heart. I
will see, when I get home, whether I cannot make
the new Queen some handsome presents. The Crim
Tartary crown diamonds are uncommonly fine, and
I shall never have any use for them. I will live and
die unmarried like Queen Elizabeth, and, of course,
I shall leave my crown to Giglio when I quit this
world. Let us go and see them married, my
dear Fairy, let me say one last farewell to him;
and then, if you please, I will return to my own
dominions.”</p>

<p>So the Fairy kissed Rosalba with peculiar tenderness,
and at once changed her wand into a very
comfortable coach-and-four, with a steady coachman,
and two respectable footmen behind, and
the Fairy and Rosalba got into the coach, which
Angelica and Bulbo entered after them. As for
honest Bulbo, he was blubbering in the most
pathetic manner, quite overcome by Rosalba’s misfortune.</p>

<p>She was touched by the honest fellow’s sympathy,
promised to restore to him the confiscated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
estates of Duke Padella his father, and
created him, as he sat there in the coach, Prince,
Highness, and First Grandee of the Crim
Tartar Empire. The coach moved on, and,
being a fairy coach, soon came up with the bridal
procession.</p>

<p>Before the ceremony at the church it was the custom
in Paflagonia, as it is in other countries, for the
bride and bridegroom to sign the Contract of
Marriage, which was to be witnessed by the Chancellor,
Minister, Lord Mayor, and principal officers
of state. Now, as the royal palace was being
painted and furnished anew, it was not ready for
the reception of the King and his bride, who proposed
at first to take up their residence at the
Prince’s palace,
that one which
Valoroso occupied
when Angelica
was born,
and before he
usurped the
throne.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/thackeray24.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="The wedding" />
</div>

<p>So the marriage
party
drove up to the
palace: the dignitaries
got out
of their carriages and stood aside: poor Rosalba
stepped out of her coach, supported by Bulbo, and
stood almost fainting up against the railings so as
to have a last look of her dear Giglio.</p>

<p>As for Blackstick, she, according to her custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
had flown out of the coach window in some inscrutable
manner, and was now standing at the
palace door.</p>

<p>Giglio came up the steps with his horrible bride
on his arm, looking as pale as if he was going to
execution. He only frowned at the Fairy Blackstick—he
was angry with her, and thought she came
to insult his misery.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, pray,” says Gruffanuff
haughtily. “I wonder why you are always poking
your nose into other people’s affairs?”</p>

<p>“Are you determined to make this poor young
man unhappy?” says Blackstick.</p>

<p>“To marry him, yes? What business is it of
yours? Pray, madam, don’t say ‘you’ to a Queen,”
cried Gruffanuff.</p>

<p>“You won’t take the money he offered you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You won’t let him off his bargain, though you
know you cheated him when you made him sign
the paper?”</p>

<p>“Impudence! Policemen, remove this woman!”
cries Gruffanuff. And the policemen were rushing
forward, but with a wave of her wand the
Fairy struck them all like so many statues in their
places.</p>

<p>“You won’t take anything in exchange for your
bond, Mrs. Gruffanuff,” cries the Fairy, with awful
severity. “I speak for the last time.”</p>

<p>“No!” shrieks Gruffanuff, stamping with her
foot. “I’ll have my husband, my husband, my
husband!”</p>

<p>“You <span class="smcap">Shall have your Husband</span>!” the Fairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Blackstick cried; and advancing a step, laid her
hand upon the nose of the Knocker.</p>

<p class="tb">As she touched it, the brass nose seemed to elongate,
the open mouth opened still wider, and
uttered a roar which made everybody start. The
eyes rolled wildly; the arms and legs uncurled
themselves, writhed about, and seemed to lengthen
with each twist; the Knocker expanded into a figure
in yellow livery, six feet high; the screws by
which it was fixed to the door unloosed themselves,
and Jenkins Gruffanuff once more trod the threshold
off which he had been lifted more than twenty
years ago!</p>

<p>“Master’s not at home,” says Jenkins, just in his
old voice; and Mrs. Jenkins, giving a dreadful
<em>youp</em>, fell down in a fit, in which nobody minded
her.</p>

<p>For everybody was shouting, “Huzzay! Huzzay!”
“Hip, hip, hurray!” “Long live the King and
Queen!”</p>

<p>“Were such things ever seen?” “No, never,
never, never!” “The Fairy Blackstick for ever!”</p>

<p>The bells were ringing double peals, the guns
roaring and banging most prodigiously. Bulbo
was embracing everybody; the Lord Chancellor
was flinging up his wig and shouting like a madman;
Hedzoff had got the Archbishop round the
waist, and they were dancing a jig for joy; and as
for Giglio, I leave you to imagine what <em>he</em> was
doing, and if he kissed Rosalba once, twice—twenty
thousand times, I’m sure I don’t think he was
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>So Gruffanuff opened the hall door with a low
bow, just as he had been accustomed to do, and
they all went in and signed the book, and then they
went to church and were married, and the Fairy
Blackstick sailed away on her cane, and was never
more heard of in Paflagonia.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
